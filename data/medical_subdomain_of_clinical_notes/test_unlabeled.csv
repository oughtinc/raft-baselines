"preoperative diagnoses:  progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function. postoperative diagnoses:  progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function. operative procedure:  coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) x4. grafts performed:  lima to lad, left radial artery from the aorta to the pda, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal. indications for procedure:  the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  he had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved lv function.  he was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries. findings during the procedure:  the aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  all distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  the smallest target was the pda, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  all the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  he was transferred on neo-synephrine, nitroglycerin, precedex drips.  cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes. details of the procedure:  the patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  after he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right ij triple-lumen catheter and cordis catheter, right radial a-line, foley catheter, tee probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  the patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest. after prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  left internal mammary artery was taken down.  simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure. heparin was given.  pericardium was opened and suspended.  during the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery. pericardium was opened and suspended.  pursestring sutures were placed.  aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  with satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  an initial dose of about 1500 ml was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart. pda was exposed first.  the right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  even in the pda, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  arteriotomy on the pda was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  end radial to side pda anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  arteriotomy was performed.  an end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  this graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and lima was accommodated in the slit on its way to the lad.  lad was exposed.  arteriotomy was performed.  an end lima to side lad anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 prolene.  lima was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle. two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 prolene.  the patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  temporary v-pacing wires were placed.  blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  left chest blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  after an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary v-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  with satisfactory hemodynamics, good lv function on tee and baseline ekg, heparin was reversed using protamine.  decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  hemostasis was assured.  mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy vicryl for musculofascial closure, and monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  dressings were applied.  the patient was transferred to the icu in stable condition.  he tolerated the procedure well.  all counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  bypass time was 120 minutes.  the patient was transferred on neo-synephrine, nitroglycerin, and precedex drips.",65

"preoperative diagnosis:  coronary artery disease. postoperative diagnosis:  coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis. description of procedure:left heart catheterization with angiography and mid abdominal aortography:under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  using the percutaneous seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  coronary arteriography was performed with 6-french performed coronary catheters.  we used a 6-french jr4 and jl4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  after using the jr4 6-french catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-french jr4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  a pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta. analysis of pressure data:  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmhg.  on continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  the aortic pressures were normal.  contours of intracardiac pressure were normal. analysis of angiograms:  selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  a pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  the mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  the left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  the aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  the ascending aorta appeared normal. pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  an abdominal aortic injection was performed.  under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  there was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  the abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  there is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  the celiac seems to be normal, but what i believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  the common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area. coronary anatomy:  one notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  cineangiogram obtained with 6-french jr4 and 5-french jr4 catheters.  prior to the introduction of the 5-french jr4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  the 6-french jr4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  there was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  the distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  the conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  we then removed the 6-french catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-french catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  at the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the shepherd turn area. the left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  it forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery. the left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  there appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  it gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  the remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what i believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  i could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place. the ramus branch is normal and free of disease. the left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease. the patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  there is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems. the patient tolerated the procedure well.  the catheter was removed.  hemostasis was achieved.  the patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. impression:1.  excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.2.  calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  the left and right renal arteries are normal.  the external iliac arteries are normal.3.  essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.4.  ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  the proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.5.  coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries. recommendations:  the patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  the ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  it is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an ivus and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  we will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  continue aggressive medical therapy.",69

"<strong>history:</strong> this is a digital eeg performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures. <strong>background activity:</strong> the background activity consists of a 8 hz to 9 hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. this rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. there are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 hz to 5 hz which suggests possible parkinson&#8217;s. part of the eeg is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. there are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. at one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. <strong>activation procedures:</strong> photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality. <strong>sleep patterns:</strong> no sleep architecture was observed during this tracing. <strong>impression:</strong> this awake/alert/drowsy eeg is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. the slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. the tremor probably represents a parkinson&#8217;s tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.",75

"history of present illness:  this is a 48-year-old black male with stage iv chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to hiv nephropathy who presents to clinic for followup having missed prior clinic appointments.  he was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by dr. x.  this is the first time that i have met the patient.  the patient&#8217;s history of renal insufficiency dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an hiv-associated complication.  he is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our renal clinic for approximately one year.  he had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  when he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his haart regimen.  since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his hiv and is seeing dr. y in our infectious disease clinic.  he is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  his last cd4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  he has had no hiv complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  the patient is also followed by dr. z at the outpatient va clinic, here in abcd, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  the patient has an av fistula that was placed in late 2006.  the latest blood work that i have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a gfr of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  these laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  the only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  he was given ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.  he says that he has trouble getting to sleep.  the ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again.  he is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps.  he has no history of excessive snoring or apneic periods.  he has no history of falling asleep at work or while driving.  he has never had a formal sleep study.  he does continue to work in sales at a local butcher shop. review of systems:  he denies any change in his appetite.  he has actually gained some weight in recent months.  he denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort.  he denies any pruritus.  he denies any lower extremity edema.  all other systems are reviewed and negative. past medical history:1.  stage iv chronic kidney

his ferritin is 258, iron is 55, and percent sat is 24. impression:  this is a 48-year-old black male with stage iv chronic kidney disease likely secondary to hiv nephropathy, although there is no history of renal biopsy, who has been noncompliant with the renal clinic and presents today for followup at the recommendation of his infection disease doctors. recommendations:1.  renal.  his serum creatinine is progressively worsening.  his creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3.  this represents a gfr of 19.  this is stage iv chronic kidney disease.  he does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use.  he is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia.  otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time.  i am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get the patient in to the dialysis teaching classes.  he has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes.  i have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm.  i am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant.  given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, i will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.2.  hypertension.  i have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen.  he shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his lasix could be increased.  goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.3.  hyperkalemia.  i am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  i will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  if his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.4.  bone metabolism.  his pth is elevated and i am going to add phoslo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  his corrected calcium is 9.7, and i would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.5.  acid base.  his bicarbonate is 18 and i will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.6.  anemia.  his hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease.  his iron stores are adequate.7.  nutrition.  his albumin is 3.2 and this is fairly close to his baseline over the past several months.8.  hiv.  his most recent cd4 count is 350.  he has been very compliant, it seems, with his antiretroviral therapy.  he has followup with dr. y.9.  transplant candidacy.  i have informed the patient that he may indeed be a candidate for transplant, although he is likely to need dialysis before he could be transplanted.  i have instructed him to try to stop smoking.  this is for making him a better candidate.  i have also encouraged him to continue to be compliant with his antiretroviral therapies as this would be a requirement for transplant. disposition:  the patient is to return to clinic in one month&#8217;s time.",94
"chief complaint:  intractable epilepsy, here for video eeg. history of present illness:  the patient is a 9-year-old male who has history of global developmental delay and infantile spasms.  ultimately, imaging study shows an mri with absent genu of the corpus callosum and thinning of the splenium of the corpus callosum, showing a pattern of cerebral dysgenesis.  he has had severe global developmental delay, and is nonverbal.  he can follow objects with his eyes, but has no ability to interact with his environment to any great degree.  he has noted if any purposeful use of the hands.  he has abnormal movements constantly, which are more choreiform and dystonic.  he has spastic quadriparesis, which is variable at times.  the patient is unable to sit or stand, and receives all his nutrition via g-tube. the patient began having seizures in infancy presenting as infantile spasms.  i began seeing him at 20 months of age.  at that point, he had undergone workup in seattle, washington and then was seeing dr. x, child neurologist in mexico, who started vigabatrin for infantile spasms.  the patient had benefit from this medication, and was doing well at that time with regard to that seizure type.  he initially was on phenobarbital, which failed to give him benefit.  he continued on phenobarbital; however, for a long period time thereafter.  the patient then began having more tonic seizures after his episodic spasms had subsided, and failed several medication trials including valproic acid, topamax, and zonegran at least briefly.  upon starting lamictal, he began to have benefit and then actually had 1-year seizure freedom before having an isolated seizure or 2.  over the next 6 months to a year, he only had few further seizures, and was doing well in a general sense.  it was more recently that he began having new seizure events that have not responded to higher doses of lamictal up to 15 mg/kg/day.  these events manifest as tonic spells with eye deviation and posturing.  mother reports flexion of the upper extremities, extension with lower extremities.  during that time, he is not able to cry or say any sounds.  these events last from seconds to minutes, and occur at least multiple times per week.  there are times where he has none for a few days and other times where he has multiple days in a row with events.  he has another event manifesting as flexion of the upper extremities and extension lower extremities where he turns red and cries throughout.  he may vomit after these episodes, then seems to calm down.  it is unclear whether this is a seizure or whether the patient is still responsive. medications:  the patient&#8217;s medications include lamictal for a total of 200 mg twice a day.  it is a 150 mg tablet and 25 mg tablets.  he is on zonegran using 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice daily, and baclofen 10 mg three times day.  he has other medications including the xopenex and atrovent. review of systems:  at this time is negative any fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal complaints, rashes, arthritis, or arthralgias.  no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  he has no change in his skills at this point. family history:  noncontributory. physical examination:general:  the patient is a slender male who is microcephalic.  he has eeg electrodes in place and is on the video eeg at that time.heent:  his oropharynx shows no lesions.neck:  supple without adenopathy.chest:  clear to auscultation.cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs.abdomen:  benign with g-tube in place.extremities:  reveal no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.neurological:  the patient is alert and has bilateral esotropia.  he is able to fix and follow objects briefly.  he is unable to reach for objects.  he exhibits constant choreiform movements when excited.  these are more prominent in the upper extremities and lower extremities.  he has some dystonic posture with flexion of the wrist and fingers bilaterally.  he also has plantar flexion at the ankles bilaterally.  his cranial nerves reveal that his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  extraocular movements are intact other than bilateral esotropia.  his face moves symmetrically.  palate elevates in midline.  hearing appears intact bilaterally. motor exam reveals dystonic and variable tone, overall there is mild in spasticity both upper and lower extremities as described above.  he has clonus at the ankles bilaterally, and some valgus contracture of the ankles.  his sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally.  deep tendon reflexes are 2 to 3+ bilaterally. impression/plan:  this is a 9-year-old male with congenital brain malformation and intractable epilepsy.  he has microcephaly as well as dystonic cerebral palsy.  he had a re-emergence of seizures, which are difficult to classify, although some sound like tonic episodes and others are more concerning for non-epileptic phenomenon, such as discomfort.  he is admitted for video eeg to hopefully capture both of these episodes and further clarify the seizure type or types.  he will remain hospitalized for probably at least 48 hours to 72 hours.  he could be discharged sooner if multiple events are captured.  his medications, we will continue his current dose of zonegran and lamictal for now.  both of these medications are very long acting, discontinuing them while in the hospital may simply result in severe seizures after discharge.",95

office setting where he sometimes works. he first remembers having difficulty with concentration in college, but his mother has pointed out to him that at some point in his early education, one teacher commented that he may have problems with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. symptoms have included difficulty sustaining attention (especially in reading), not seeming to listen one spoke into directly, failure to finish task, difficulty with organization, avoiding task requiring sustained mental effort, losing things, being distracted by extraneous stimuli, being forgetful. in the past, probably in high school, the patient recalled being more figidity than now. he tensed to feel anxious. sleep has been highly variable. he will go for perhaps months at a time with middle insomnia and early morning awakening (3:00 a.m.), and then may sleep well for a month. appetite has been good. he has recently gained about 15 pounds, but notes that he lost about 30 pounds during the time he was taking adderall. he tends to feel depressed. his energy level is &#8220;better now,&#8221; but this was very problematic in the past. he has problems with motivation. in the past, he had passing thoughts of suicide, but this is no longer a problem. <strong>psychiatric history:</strong> the patient has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes. his only treatment has been at this facility. he tried adderall for a time, and it helped, but he became hypertensive. lunesta is effective for his insomnia issues. effexor has helped to some degree. he has been prescribed provigil, as much as 200 mg q.a.m., but has been cutting it down to 100 mg q.a.m. with some success. he sometimes takes the other half of the tablet in the afternoon. <strong>substance abuse history:</strong> caffeine: two or three cups of coffee per day, and soda at lunch time. tobacco: denied. alcohol: one glass of wine per week. the cage screening questions are answered in the negative. illicit drugs: none at present. in high school, he tried marijuana a couple of times, and cocaine once. we discussed some of the major risk of these substances. <strong>medical history and review of symptoms:</strong> constitutional: see history of present illness. no recent fever or sweats. neurological: no history of seizures or migraine headaches. the patient did have a wrestling injury that resulted in a hole in one retina, but he had no loss of consciousness with that injury. heent: as mentioned above, &#8220;hole&#8221; in one retina. cardiovascular: the patient has been hypertensive in the past with adderall, and recently he has had some episodes where his blood pressure was noted to be high, which may be related to his back pain. pulmonary: denied. gastrointestinal: gerd. the patient has ongoing nausea, which is thought possibly to be related to adhesions. he has no history of liver disease or peptic ulcer disease. endocrine and hematological: denied. dermatological: eczema as a child. musculoskeletal: chronic back pain from the herniated disc. he was involved in a motor vehicle accident, a head-on bus crash in the distant past. he is presently awaiting evaluation for possible surgery. genitourinary: denied. other: denied. <strong>surgeries:</strong> nissen fundoplication for gerd. removal of necrotic tissue from his left flank, following an accidental gunshot wound at age 18;

"reason for referral:  ms. a is a 60-year-old african-american female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in july.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. relevant background information:  historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with ms. a.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. history of presenting problem:  ms. a presented to the abc hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  neurological evaluation with dr. x confirmed left hemiparesis.  brain ct showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received tpa and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  these symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  she was transferred to the icu for monitoring.  ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ica and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ica.  on 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right mca/cva.  at discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all adls and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  she was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  she returned to the sinai er on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt &quot;just like the stroke.&quot;  brain ct on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing &quot;mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,&quot; but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  neurological examination with dr. y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis. followup ct on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  mri could not be completed due to the patient&#8217;s weight.  she was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that ms. a referred to this as a second stroke. ms. a presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with dr. x on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  she demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  during the current interview, ms. a reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  she also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  when asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  she reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the social security agency that she works at.  note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  she also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty. other medical history:  as mentioned, ms. a continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  she was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by dr. x on the need to use her cpap because she indicated she never used it at night.  she reported that since her appointment with dr. x, she has been using it &quot;every other night.&quot;  when asked about daytime fatigue, ms. a initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  she reported at times &quot;snoring&quot; and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  she receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke). current medications:  aspirin 81 mg daily, colace 100 mg b.i.d., lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol mdi p.r.n. substance use:  ms. a denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  she used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago. family medical history:  ms. a had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  she reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  her father has gout and blood clots.  siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and gi tumors.  she was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc. social history:  ms. a completed high school degree.  she reported that she primarily obtained b&#8217;s and c&#8217;s in school.  she received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity. she currently works for the social security administration in data processing.  as mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  she is now living on her own.  she has never driven.  she reported that she continues to perform adls independently such as cooking and cleaning.  she lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  she previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  she also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  she has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the bahamas at the end of october. psychiatric history:  ms. a did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  she reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  she reported that this only &quot;comes and goes.&quot;

however, it was noted that there was a trade-off between speed and accuracy in her performances on more complex attentional tasks that required greater levels of focus as she tended to complete the task slowly in order to accurately discriminate between target and nontarget visual stimuli.  on a visual sustained attention task, her overall number of errors and response rate were within broad normal limits, but it was noted that her response speed slowed and the accuracy of her responses became less consistent as the test progressed suggesting weaknesses in vigilance.  it was also noted that she was slower to respond and there was more variability in response accuracy when stimuli were presented with longer interstimulus intervals suggesting some weaknesses in arousal and activation when information was presented at a slower rate.  taking together these results highlight deficits in working memory (e.g. complex attention and mental manipulation), sustained attention and vigilance while her more basic and immediate attentional abilities were within broad normal limits.  fatigue was likely a factor in these results.  it is unlikely that ms. a actually fell asleep during this task as her error rate is not very high; however, there were noted decreases in measures that are sensitive to arousal and activation. information processing speed:  as mentioned, ms. a tended to perform within expected limits on brief verbal and visual tasks that involved basic processing.  she had more difficulty maintaining consistency in her response rate and tended to become slower on tasks that require sustained attention and more complex discrimination of stimuli. language:  confrontation naming was in the impaired range, but this may be in part due to lack of familiarity with certain objects given her weak performance on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge.  minor errors were noted on sentence repetition task, but this may be due to weaknesses in attention and working memory. similarly, her low average performance on a verbal comprehension task may have been due to some weaknesses in vigilance as she was noted to fall asleep at times during this task.  verbal fluency for both phonemic and semantic cues was within the average range.  as taken together some weaknesses in aspects of language appear to have been due to limitations in attention and verbal knowledge store. visuospatial perception and organization:  ms. a performed within the average range and within expected limits on visuospatial construction tasks that involved matching to a sample using either blocks or drawing; however, she had notable difficulties when we attempted to assess her perception of angular line orientations.  these results suggest some reliance on external cues and information for accurate interpretation of visuospatial stimuli and difficulty with perception when such cues are not present to structure her perception.  note that fatigue may have also been a factor here as well. learning &#038; memory skills:   verbal learning and memory:  on contextual memory task (i.e. stories), ms. a performed in the borderline range in immediate recall.  following a delay, she retained 62% of the information that she originally learned and recall was again in the borderline range.  delayed recognition was low average.  on a task assessing her ability to learn large amounts of seemingly unorganized information (i.e. list), her initial acquisition of information was in the low average range.  with repetition, her performance improved and her overall immediate learning fell in the average range.  following a short delay, she was only able to spontaneously recall about a third of the information that she had initially learned and her overall performance fell in the borderline range.  with cueing, she was able to recall more information, but relative to her same age peers this performance still fell in the borderline range.  recall following a long delay was in the borderline to low average range and recognition was borderline as she did not recognize a number of the original target stimuli.  of note, she made a number of repetitions and intrusion errors some of which were semantically related to the list target items and were repeatedly given suggesting some difficulty in correcting her responses with feedback and in monitoring or organizing her responses.  taken together these results highlight difficulties in learning large amounts of verbal information due primarily to difficulties with the initial organizing or learning of the information, although some weaknesses in retrieval were also noted.  these results are likely due to the above noted attention and working memory deficits as she was able to at least recognize most of the information that she had initially learned.   non-verbal/visual learning and memory:  ms. a&#8217;s initial recall of the details in spatial location of the series of visual designs is in the low average range.  she retained most of this information following a delay with recall and recognition falling in the average range.  immediate recall of a complex figure drawing was in the average range.  following a 30-minute delay, she retained most of this information although statistically her result fell in the low average range.  recognition of the individual component parts of the larger figure fell in the low average range.  taken together these results suggest that ms. a was mildly limited in the amount of information that she could initially learn, but the fact that she was able to retain most of that information over time suggests that any difficulties in learning visual information occurred during initial encoding.  this pattern of results is similar to those found for verbal information. executive functioning:  ms. a performed within the low average-to-average range on tasks assessing verbal fluency, cognitive set shifting, and inhibition of prepotent responses; however, it should be noted that ms. a made a number of errors on these tasks particularly for inhibition, although she was able to successfully correct those errors. across tasks and during interactions it was noted that ms. a had some weaknesses in organization.  visual and verbal abstract reasoning were in the borderline range and deficits in working memory were noted.  taken together these results highlight some weaknesses in executive functioning. motor/psychomotor functioning:  ms. a performed in the impaired range with her dominant right hand and her nondominant hand on a task assessing speeded fine motor coordination. emotional functioning:  ms. a&#8217;s overall score on a self-report effective screening measure suggested that she is currently experiencing mild levels of depression.  she endorsed symptoms related to dysphoria, anxiety, lack of energy, anhedonia, hopelessness, and cognitive problems. summary &#038; impressions:  ms. a was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x, m.d. to follow up noted cognitive weaknesses following a right middle cerebral artery stroke that was seen on a neuropsychological screening.  test results suggested that ms. a was premorbidly performing in the low average to average range.  based on this estimate, she performed within expected limits on tasks assessing immediate attention and speed for processing brief, simple, and straightforward information.  most aspects of language (i.e. repetition, comprehension, and fluency), and visuospatial construction (i.e. matching to sample).  deficits were seen primarily in the areas of complex attention or working memory and sustained attention.  she had difficulty mentally manipulating information in mind and on longer task that required focus.  she demonstrated poor vigilance, difficulty with discrimination of stimuli, and declines in arousal and activation.  these attentional deficits affected her ability to learn verbal and visual information.  weaknesses in executive functioning were also noted based on her performances across tasks as well as behavioral observations as she demonstrated weaknesses in abstract thinking, organization, inhibition, and behavioral and response regulation.  combined with the deficits seen for fine motor skills, these results are consistent with frontal subcortical changes as were seen on her cat scan.  in addition, ms. a demonstrated some difficulty completing a task that involved interpreting directionally based visuospatial stimuli in the absence of other cues to aid with perception and these findings may be consistent with the involvement of the right hemisphere in her recent stroke; however, given that no mri was conducted it is difficult to say whether or not there are specific regions of infarct in her right hemisphere. overall, these results are consistent with those seen on her recent neuropsychological screening.  this evaluation was requested in order to further clarify those results.  as noted above, ms. a does have a number of areas of deficit; however, these results do not support a dementing process at this time.  the pattern of findings as mentioned are consistent with subcortical changes, but may also be secondary to her poorly treated sleep apnea as she was noticeably tired and particular deficits were noticed on tasks that required complex or sustained attention.  thus it will be important for ms. a to increase compliance with treatment for sleep apnea and also to ensure that other cardiovascular risk factors are monitored and controlled through diet, exercise, and medication.  given that she is working full-time and these cognitive deficits could create significant problems on the job, it will be important that ms. a address these issues while she is still completing a lighter load at work.  additional recommendations are provided below. recommendations:1.  it is imperative that ms. a address her sleep apnea and comply consistently i.e. every evening with wearing her cpap.  given that she continues to complain about it and report the claustrophobia prevents her from using it regularly, ms. a should see a sleep specialist in order to determine alternate ways to address this problem.2.  ms. a reported mild levels of depression and anxiety on this evaluation and it was previously recommended that she contact xyz to inquire about counseling and management of multiple life stressors.3.  ms. a should see an ophthalmologist to update her eyeglass prescription.  it may have contributed to the noted deficits on one visuospatial task.4.  continued pt and home exercises i recommended to improve physical abilities.5.  ms. a is likely not obtaining enough physical exercise and it is suggested that she work with her physical therapist and primary care physician to determine exercise regimen in order to help her lose weight.6.  the following recommendations are provided to aid ms. a with the noted difficulties with attention and memory.  she may also benefit from cognitive therapy in order to learn to apply these strategies at work.7.  ms. a&#8217;s cardio and cerebrovascular risk factors should be closely monitored and the results of this evaluation should be shared with all of her physicians. thank you for referring this interesting patient for evaluation.  a neuropsychological reevaluation is recommended in one to two years in order to monitor cognitive functioning.  reevaluation should occur earlier if there is any worsening of cognitive functioning.",119
"informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained.  the risks that were explained were bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon.  conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position. a colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve.  this was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good.  the ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal.  the colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed. complications:  none.",120

"discharge diagnosis:1.  respiratory failure improved.2.  hypotension resolved.3.  anemia of chronic disease stable.4.  anasarca improving.5.  protein malnourishment improving.6.  end-stage liver disease. history and hospital course:  the patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  his bowel function started to improve.  he was on tpn prior to coming to hospital.  he has remained on tpn throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  the patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the intensive care unit on dopamine.  at one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  the patient also was requiring bipap to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  this has been treated successfully with zyvox and levaquin and diflucan.  he seems to be currently doing much better.  he is only using bipap in the evening.  as stated above, he is eating better.  he had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  this may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  the patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  this morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  he states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  he will be discharged to garden court skilled nursing facility. discharge medications/instructions:  he is going to be going with protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and miralax 17 gm p.o. daily.  the patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  he is also going to need respiratory care to work with his bipap.  his initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, peep of 6, fio2 of 40%.  the patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up. physical examination:vital signs:  on the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, o2 sat 97%.general:  a well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.heent:  unremarkable.cardiovascular:  positive s1, s2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.lungs:  clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.abdomen:  positive for bowel sounds.  soft, nondistended.  he does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  this does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  the swelling in this area also appears improved.extremities:  show no clubbing or cyanosis.  he does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.neurologic:  the patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  he is alert and aware of surroundings.  we have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.musculoskeletal:  the patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  he is just weak in general. laboratory data:  lab work done today shows the following:  white count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, co2 26, glucose 79, bun 56, and creatinine 1.4.  calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9. plan:  discharge this gentleman from hospital and admit him to garden court snf where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  he has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  the family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.",125
"procedure:  left heart catheterization, left ventriculography, selective coronary angiography. indication:  this lady with a previous left internal mammary graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse margin branch, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery presented with recurrent difficulties with breathing.  this was felt to be related largely to chronic obstructive lung disease.  she had dynamic t-wave changes in precordial leads.  cardiac enzymes were indeterminate.  she was evaluated by dr. x and given her previous history and multiple risk factors it was elected to proceed with cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. risks of the procedure including risks of conscious sedation, death, cerebrovascular accident, dye reaction, need for emergency surgery, vascular access injury and/or infection, and risks of cath-based interventions were discussed in detail.  the patient understood and agreed to proceed. description of the procedure:  the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.  under versed and fentanyl sedation, the right groin was sterilely prepped and draped.  local anesthesia was obtained with 2% xylocaine.  the right femoral artery was entered using modified seldinger technique and a 4-french introducer sheath placed in that vessel.  through the indwelling femoral arterial sheath, a jl4 4-french catheter was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, appropriately aspirated and flushed.  ascending aortic root pressures obtained.  this catheter was utilized in an attempt to cannulate the left coronary ostium.  this catheter was too small, was exchanged for a jl5 4-french catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta, the cath appropriately aspirated and flushed, and advanced to left coronary ostium and multiple views of left coronary artery obtained. this catheter was then exchanged for a 4-french right coronary catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  the catheter appropriately aspirated and flushed.  the catheter was advanced in the right coronary artery.  multiple views of that vessel were obtained.  the catheter was then sequentially advanced to the saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, and left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, and multiple views of those vessels were obtained.  this catheter was then exchanged for a 4-french pigtail catheter, which was advanced over the wire to the ascending aorta.  the catheter was appropriately aspirated and flushed and advanced to left ventricle, baseline left ventricular pressures obtained. following this, left ventriculography was performed in a 30-degree rao projection using 30 ml of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  post left ventriculography pressures were then obtained as was a pullback pressure across the aortic valve.  videotapes were then reviewed.  it was elected to terminate the procedure at that point in time. the vascular sheath was removed and manual compression carried out.  excellent hemostasis was obtained.  the patient tolerated the procedure without complication. results of procedure1.  hemodynamics:  left ventricular end-diastolic filling pressure was 24.  there was no gradient across the aortic valve.2.  left ventriculography:  left ventriculography demonstrated well-preserved left ventricular systolic function.  mild inferobasilar hypokinesis was noted.  no significant mitral regurgitation noted.  ejection fraction was estimated at 60%.3.  coronary arteriographya.  left main coronary:  the left main coronary was patent.b.  left anterior descending coronary artery:  left anterior descending coronary was occluded shortly after a very small first septal perforator was given.c.  circumflex coronary artery:  circumflex coronary artery was occluded at its origin.d.  right coronary artery.  right coronary artery was occluded in its mid portion.4.  saphenous vein graft angiographya.  saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch:  the saphenous vein graft to diagonal branch was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites.  excellent flow was noted in the diagonal system with some retrograde flow.b.  there was retrograde flow as well in the left anterior descending system.c.  saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal system:  saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal system was widely patent at its origin and insertion sites.  there was no graft disease noted.  excellent flow was noted in the bifurcating marginal system.d.  saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery:  saphenous vein graft to right coronary was widely patent with no graft disease.  origin and insertion sites were free of disease.  distal flow in the graft to the posterior descending was normal.5.  left internal mammary artery angiography:  left internal mammary artery angiography demonstrated a widely patent left internal mammary at its origin and insertion sites.  there was no focal disease noted, inserted into the mid-to-distal lad which was a small-caliber vessel.  retrograde filling of a small septal system was noted. summary of results1.  elevated left ventricular end-diastolic filling pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function and mild hypokinesis of inferobasilar segment.2.  occluded native right coronary, left anterior descending, and circumflex coronary arteries.3.  widely patent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery, obtuse marginal system, diagonal system.4.  widely patent left internal mammary artery and left anterior descending. recommendations:  the patient needs no additional

"name of procedure:  left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography. indications:  acute coronary syndrome. technique of procedure:  standard judkins, right groin.  catheters used were a 6 french pigtail, 6 french jl4, 6 french jr4.   anticoagulation:  the patient was on heparin at the time. complications:  none. i reviewed with the patient the pros, cons, alternatives, risks of catheterization and sedation including myocardial infarction, stroke, death, damage to nerve, artery or vein in the leg, perforation of a cardiac chamber, dissection of an artery requiring countershock, infection, bleeding, atn allergy, need for cardiac surgery.  all questions were answered, and the patient desired to proceed. hemodynamic data:  aortic pressure was in the physiologic range.  no significant gradient across the aortic valve. angiographic data1. ventriculogram:  the left ventricle is of normal size and shape, normal wall motion, normal ejection fraction.2. right coronary artery:  dominant.  there was insignificant disease in the system.3. left coronary:  left main, left anterior descending and circumflex systems showed no significant disease. conclusions1. normal left ventricular systolic function.2. insignificant coronary disease. plan:  based upon this study, medical therapy is warranted.  six-french angio-seal was used in the groin.",127
"reason for consult:  i was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior st-elevation mi. history of present illness:  the patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom i had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  the patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  at about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  then, she began vomiting.  when the patient&#8217;s daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes. she came to the emergency room, an ekg showed inferior st-elevation mi.  i was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, i felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with pci/cabg.  she was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  repeat ekg shows normalization of her st elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes. past medical history:  significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  in early-to-mid december, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  we did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  she is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple cva. medications:  medications as an outpatient:1.  amiodarone 200 mg once a day.2.  roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain. allergies:  codeine.  no shrimp, seafood, or dye allergy. family history:  negative for cardiac disease. social history:  she does not smoke cigarettes.  she uses alcohol.  no use of illicit drugs.  she is divorced and lives with her daughter.  she is a retired medical librarian from florida. review of systems:  unable to be obtained due to the patient&#8217;s aphasia. physical examination:  height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  o2 saturation 100%.  on general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  heent shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has dry mucosal membrane.  she now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  neck veins are not distended.  no carotid bruits visible.  skin:  warm, well perfused.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2, regular rate.  no significant murmurs.  pmi is nondisplaced.  abdomen:  soft, nondistended.  extremities:  without edema, on limited exam.  neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop. diagnostic/laboratory data:  ekgs as reviewed above.  her last ecg shows normalization of prior st elevation in the inferior leads with q waves and first-degree av block, pr interval 280 milliseconds.  further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, bun 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, inr 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179. chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion. impression:  the patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  i will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of. recommendations:1.  i think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.2.  morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.3.  would avoid other blood thinners including plavix, integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion. other management as per the medical service.  i have discussed the case with dr. x of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.",128
"reason for consultation:  new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. history of present illness:  abcd is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage iv metastatic disease.  we are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options. abcd and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  a ct scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  at that point, he was transferred to xyz hospital for further evaluation.  on admission on 12/19/08, a ct scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  the ct scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  this was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the svc and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  there was an abnormal lymph node noted in the ap window and left hilar region.  there was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  there was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  there were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  there was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  there was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  in the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  all other structures appeared normal.  on 12/22/08, a ct-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  at this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options. on further review, abcd states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  he has not ever had a chronic smoker&#8217;s cough and still does not have a cough.  he has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  he and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis. past medical history:  he denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems. past surgical history:  he denies having any surgeries. allergies:  no known drug allergies. medications:  at home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  he does take a multivitamin on occasion. social history:  he has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.  he used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a dui about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked.  since that time he has worked with printing press.  he is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home. family history:  his mother died for alcohol-related complications.  he otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems. review of systems:  general/constitutional:  he has lost about 20 pounds of weight as described above.  he also has a trouble with fatigue.  no lightheadedness or dizziness.  heent:  he denies any new or changing headache, change in vision, double vision, or loss of vision, ringing in his ears, loss of hearing in one year.  he does not take care of his teeth very well but currently he has no mouth, jaw, or teeth pain.  respiratory:  he has had some little bit of dyspnea on exertion but otherwise denies shortness of breath at rest.  no cough, congestion, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sputum production.  cvs:  he denies any chest pains, palpitations, pnd, orthopnea, or swelling of his lower extremities.  gi:  he denies any odynophagia, dysphagia, heartburn on a regular basis, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or black tarry stools.  he has been somewhat constipated recently.  gu:  he denies any burning with urination, kidney stones, blood in his urine, dysuria, difficulty getting his urine out or other problems.  musculoskeletal:  he denies any new bony aches or pains including back pain, hip pain, and rib pain.  no muscle aches, no joint swelling, and no history of gout.  skin:  no rashes, no bruising, petechia, non-healing wounds, or ulcerations.  he has had no nail or

are intact.  he has intact sensation to light touch throughout.  he has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes.  he is alert and oriented x3. laboratory data:  his white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000.  the differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, co2 of 31, bun 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, ast 16, alt 12, total

white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  there is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. assessment/plan:  abcd is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  at this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  his wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  they preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  i did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  at this point, he has an excellent functional status and i think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well. in terms of chemotherapy, i talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to gi upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  i would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  this would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  this cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  the goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication. in terms of staging mr. abcd&#8217;s had all the appropriate staging.  a pet-ct scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the ct scans that we have. at this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  he will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  as this is the holiday weekend, i do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but i did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on monday.  at that point, we will get him in and i will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy. thank you very much for this interesting consult.",129
"problem:  rectal bleeding, positive celiac sprue panel. history:  the patient is a 19-year-old irish-greek female who ever since elementary school has noted diarrhea, constipation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching, abdominal discomfort, change in bowel habits.  she noted that her symptoms were getting increasingly worse and so she went for evaluation and was finally tested for celiac sprue and found to have a positive tissue transglutaminase as well as antiendomysial antibody.  she has been on a gluten-free diet for approximately one week now and her symptoms are remarkably improved.  she actually has none of these symptoms since starting her gluten-free diet.  she has noted intermittent rectal bleeding with constipation, on the toilet tissue.  she feels remarkably better after starting a gluten-free diet. allergies:  no known drug allergies. operations:  she is status post a tonsillectomy as well as ear tubes. illnesses:  questionable kidney stone. medications:  none. habits:  no tobacco.  no ethanol. social history:  she lives by herself.  she currently works in a dental office. family history:  notable for a mother who is in good health, a father who has joint problems and questionable celiac disease as well.  she has two sisters and one brother.  one sister interestingly has inflammatory arthritis. review of systems:  notable for fever, fatigue, blurred vision, rash and itching; her gi symptoms that were discussed in the hpi are actually resolved in that she started the gluten-free diet.  she also notes headaches, anxiety, heat and cold intolerance, excessive thirst and urination.  please see symptoms summary sheet dated april 18, 2005. physical examination:   general:  she is a well-developed pleasant 19 female.  she has a blood pressure of 120/80, a pulse of 70, she weighs 170 pounds.  she has anicteric sclerae.  pink conjunctivae.  perrla.  ent:  mmm.  neck:  supple.  lungs: clear to auscultation.   heart:  regular rate and rhythm.  abdomen: soft, nondistended and nontender.  good bowel sounds.  rectal:  she has no external hemorrhoids and no probable internal hemorrhoids on exam.  lymph:  no cervical lymphadenopathy.  extremities: no edema.  no rash.  neuro/psych:  orientation, memory, motor and gait are intact. impression/plan:  the patient is a 19-year-old female with what appears to be celiac sprue, that is markedly improved on a gluten-free diet.  i discussed with her and her mother that the gold standard really is a small bowel biopsy, but she would have to go back on her gluten diet to obtain the study.  at this point in time, she does not seem to be quite interested in that as she feels to be markedly better for the first time in many years.  i have given her a handout regarding celiac disease as well as a gluten-free diet and we will go ahead and obtain a small bowel follow through as it seems as if she has had symptoms for many years.  we will check a tsh as well as a cbc to make sure she is not anemic and secondary to the rectal bleeding and a sister with inflammatory arthritis, we will go ahead and check a flexible sigmoidoscopy to make sure there are no signs of inflammatory bowel disease.",130

"preoperative diagnosis:  prior history of polyps. postoperative diagnosis:  small polyps, no evidence of residual or recurrent polyp in the cecum. premedications:  versed 5 mg, demerol 100 mg iv. reported procedure:  the rectal chamber revealed no external lesions.  prostate was normal in size and consistency. the colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum.  the position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve.  navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed. the cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen.  there was not even a scar representing the prior polyp.  i was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and i saw no lesion at all.  the scope was then slowly withdrawn.  in the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma.  it was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa.  there was a similar lesion in the descending colon.  both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them.  there were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon.  in addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery.  there was no bleeding.  the scope was then withdrawn.  the rectum was normal.  when the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare.  there was no specimen and there was no bleeding.  the scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated. endoscopic impression:1.  small polyps, sigmoid colon, resected them.2.  diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.3.  small rectal polyps, obliterated them.4.  submucosal lesions, consistent with lipomata as described.5.  no evidence of residual or recurrent neoplasm in the cecum.",132
"reason for neurological consultation:  muscle twitching, clumsiness, progressive pain syndrome, and gait disturbance. history of present illness:  the patient is a 62-year-old african-american male with a significant past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual right-sided weakness as well as two mis, status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001.  he states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands.  more recently, he describes a burning sensation along with numbness.  this has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern.  over the last six months, he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands.  he denies any weakness per se, just clumsiness and decreased sensation.  he has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks, which occur in both hands and his shoulders.  this has been a fairly longstanding problem, and again has become more prevalent recently.  he does not have any tremor.  he denies any neck pain.  he walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. recently, he has tried gabapentin, but this was not effective for pain control.  oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief.  because of the pain, he has significant problems with fractured sleep.  he states he has not had a good night&#8217;s sleep in many years.  about six months ago, after an mi and pacemaker insertion, he was transferred to a nursing facility.  at that facility, his insulin was stopped.  since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes.  he denies any back pain, neck pain, change in bowel or bladder function, or specific injury pre-dating these symptoms. past medical history:  diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, arthritis, gerd, and headaches. medications:  trazodone, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, prevacid, lisinopril, glipizide, and gabapentin. family history:  discussed above and documented on the chart. social history:  discussed above and documented on the chart.  he does not smoke.  he lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids.  he previously was a security guard, but is currently on disability. review of systems:  discussed above and documented on the chart. physical examination:  on examination, blood pressure 150/80, pulse of 80, respiratory rate 22, and weight 360 pounds.  pain scale 7/10.  a full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart. the patient is obese with significant ankle edema. neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination.  motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral fdis, but still has a strong grip.  individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.  tone and bulk are normal.  sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally.  he has no vibration sense at his knees.  similarly, there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally.  the only reflexes i could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps.  remaining reflexes were unelicitable.  no babinski.  the patient walks normally with the aid of a cane.  he has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided.  positive romberg with eyes open and closed. impression and plan:1.  probable painful diabetic neuropathy.  symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning, with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities.  he has relative preservation of motor function.  because these symptoms are progressive and, by report, he came off his insulin, suggesting somewhat mild diabetes, i would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy.2.  he has history of myoclonic jerks.  i did not see any on my examination today and i feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia, which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy.  i would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy. i have recommended the following:1.  emg/nerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.2.  blood work, looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus, to include cbc, cmp, tsh, lft, b12, rpr, esr, lyme titer, and hba1c, and ammonia level.3.  neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective, and i have recommended cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d.  side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.4.  i have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and i have recommended tight diabetic control.5.  i will see him at followup at the emg.",133

endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on june 22, 2007.  the patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  after appropriate cross match and workup of hla typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney. preoperative diagnosis:  endstage renal disease. postoperative diagnosis:  endstage renal disease. procedure:  cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis. estimated blood loss:  400 ml. fluids:  one liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin. anesthesia:  general endotracheal. specimen:  none. drain:  none. complications:  none. the patient tolerated the procedure without any complication. procedure in detail:  the patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  after adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the asis down to the suprapubic space.  after this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  camper&#8217;s and scarpa&#8217;s were dissected with electrocautery.  hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  the external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  after these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  after the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  after the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  this was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  the round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  the dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  this alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  after the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  the right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  after the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  an additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  this was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  the dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  at this time, satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  this was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  the heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  the renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  a 5-0 double-ended prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 prolene, these were tied down and secured.  the renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  the dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  after such time the 5-0 prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  after this was done and the artery was secured, the satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  the flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  the bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  the kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  at this time, all satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  the dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  this was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  at this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  this was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  additional vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  at this time, an ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  this was inspected and noted for proper control.  irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  at this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  the kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  a 1-0 prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  this was secured and knots were dumped.  subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running monocryl.  the patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the dunn icu where he was noted to be stable.  dr. a was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure.",138

"procedure:  left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery. procedure in detail:  the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  after informed consent, he was medicated with versed and fentanyl.  the right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% xylocaine.  percutaneously, #6-french arterial sheath was placed.  selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  the patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  we initially started with a jr4 guide.  we were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  we were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  we then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  we finally had to go an al2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  that guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  the surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  we then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  we could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  no perforation and excellent flow.  during the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of angiomax.  at the end of the procedure, we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix.  we did a right femoral angiogram; however, the angio-seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a femostop.  we transported the patient to his room in stable condition. angiographic data:  left main coronary is normal.  left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal.  the diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  there is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  the rest of the lad looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  the first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the av groove branch was free of any disease.  some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  after we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  we still had about residual 70% stenosis.  when we had to go back with the al2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  we re-dilated and then deployed.  repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  we never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  after deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large pda.  the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  we got a wire through and dilated this.  we then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  there were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  the distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there. impression:  atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.",141

"history of present illness:  i was kindly asked to see ms. abc who is a 74-year-old woman for cardiology consultation regarding atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation after a fall. the patient is somnolent at this time, but does arouse, but is unable to provide much history.  by review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor.  she states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor. the patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath. past medical history:  includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension.  she follows up with dr. x in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done.  she had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated pa systolic pressure of 71 mmhg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the pa systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmhg.  other findings were not significantly changed including pericardial effusion description.  she has a history of longstanding hypertension.  she has been on hemodialysis since 1997 for renal failure, history of mini-strokes documented several years ago, history of seizure disorder, she has a history of right upper extremity edema and right breast enlargement from right subclavian vein occlusion.  she has a history of

am talking. physical exam:  temperature 99.2, blood pressure ranges from 88/41 to 108/60, pulse 70, respiratory rate, 20, o2 saturation 98%.  height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  on general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  heent shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  she has moist mucosal membranes.  neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  no carotid bruits.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  no rub, no gallop.  pmi is nondisplaced.

done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  the atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on ekg done on 11/02/07 and this ekg is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  echocardiogram results as above.  chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  bnp shows 3788.  sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, bun 49, creatinine 5.90.  troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  inr 1.03 on 05/18/07.  white blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139. impression:  ms. abc is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  she does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr. x, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  one of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin.  clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  i would defer that decision to dr. z and dr. xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate. recommendations:1.  fall assessment as per dr. z and dr. xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on coumadin.  given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.2.  the patient has elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function, i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.3.  regarding this minimal troponin elevation, i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr. x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study as well.4.  continue norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.5.  the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day

"preoperative diagnoses:  multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. postoperative diagnoses:  multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. title of the operation:1.  biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer.2.  insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under stealth stereotactic guidance.3.  right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.4.  microtechniques for all the above.5.  stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound. indications:  the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  a year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  she recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  she had a consult with radiation-oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  consequently, this operation is performed. procedure in detail:  the patient underwent a planning mri scan with stealth protocol.  she was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  she was placed on the mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  she was well padded, secured, and so forth.  the neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  the posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with betadine soak scrub followed by betadine paint.  this was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the stealth system.  sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  a biparietal incision was performed.  a linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  a biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the stealth stereotactic system.  the dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  an inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  this was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  the tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  at least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound. once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  a linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  a burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  a craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  it was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy. at the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  the tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator.  a gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well. i then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the cp angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter. meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well. the posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  the dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 nurolon.  the dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 ethibond.  subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon. for the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  the bone flap was brought on to the field.  the dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 nurolon.  at the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  the sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses. once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the lorenz microplates.  the wound was then closed in layers.  the galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 nylon. estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 l.  the patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 l of hespan and almost 3 l of crystalloid. nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.",147

"preoperative diagnosis:  left acoustic neuroma. postoperative diagnosis:  left acoustic neuroma. procedure performed:  left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma. anesthesia:  general. operative findings:  this patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  the tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections. procedure in detail:  following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  she was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with mayfield pins.  the left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve emg monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  the proposed incision was injected with 1% xylocaine with epinephrine.  next, t-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  the incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use. incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  the sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  from these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use.  the bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  there was extensively aerated temporal bone.  at this point, dr. trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  the cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  the dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  the bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  there was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  the dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  therefore, dr. trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  with dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  the eighth nerve was identified and transected.  tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  the facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  it was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  the superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  at this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  the tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  the nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  however, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  however, the tumor was then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  it was released from the brainstem ventrally.  the tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  at this point, dr. trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  the air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  a piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  next, the dura was closed with duragen and duraseal.  the bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures.  the skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 vicryl sutures.  running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the pacu in a stable condition.  all counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure. estimated blood loss:  100 ml.",154

"month dd, yyyy xyz re:  abcmedical record#:  123 dear dr. xyz: i saw abc back in neuro-oncology clinic today.  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma. within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time. after seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation. from my view, i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him.  this is very worrisome.  today, for the first time, i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future. emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  it is not that he does not want treatment, however.  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  we would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  in addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  if he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  at this stage, we are thinking of using accutane at that point. while i am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, i think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  in the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  i will look at this as a positive sign because i think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term. i will keep you apprised of followups.  if you have any questions or if i could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me. sincerely,",167

with his memory. according to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  at first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  they did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  as time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  he started to shuffle.  he started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since july of 2006.  at this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  he frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  he has not fallen in the last month.  he did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  his family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  he has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  his handwriting has become smaller and shakier. in regard to the bladder, he states, &quot;i wet the bed.&quot;  in talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  he was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  this was treated by dr. y.  dr. x does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient&#8217;s urinary incontinence.  the patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  his wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  he has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped. he has no headaches or sensation of head fullness. in regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  his wife took over his medications about two years ago.  she stopped his driving about three years ago.  she discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  apparently, he did not object.  at this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  he needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  he is a retired office machine repairman.  he is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day. he has not had pt or ot and has not been treated with medications for parkinson&#8217;s disease or alzheimer&#8217;s disease.  he has been treated for the bladder.  he has not had lumbar puncture. past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that i reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  the bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  he has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  he had a period of depression in 1999 and was on prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  he used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  this was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  she states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day. social history:  he quit smoking in 1968.  his current weight is 183 pounds.  his tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches. family history:  his grandfather had arthritis.  his father had parkinson&#8217;s disease.  his mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes. he does not have a living will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself. review of hydrocephalus risk factors:  none. allergies:  none. medications:  metformin 500 mg three times a day, lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, uroxatral 10 mg per day, detrol la 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day. physical exam:  on examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  he is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. vital signs:  his weight is 180 pounds. head:  the head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  the head circumference is 59 cm, which is the 75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm. spine:  the spine is straight and not tender.  i can easily palpate the spinous processes.  there is no scoliosis. skin:  no neurocutaneous stigmata. cardiovascular examination:  no carotid or vertebral bruits. mental status:  assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  the mini-mental state exam score was 17/30.  he did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  there was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  he could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons. cranial nerve exam:  no evidence of papilledema.  the pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement. motor exam:  normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  there is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  there is tremulousness of the outstretched hands. sensory exam:  is difficult to interpret.  either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing. cerebellar exam:  is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  there is no dysarthria. reflexes:  trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  it is not certain whether there is a babinski sign or simply withdrawal. gait:  assessed using the tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired. review of x-rays:  i personally reviewed the mri scan of the brain from december 11, 2007 at advanced radiology.  it shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  the 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  the span is enlarged at 12 mm.  the sylvian aqueduct is patent.  there is a pulsation artifact.  the corpus callosum is effaced.  there are extensive t2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  there are also scattered t2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  there is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  there is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy. assessment:  the patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  his examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  his mri scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease. problems/diagnoses:1.  possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2.  probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 &#038; 438).3.  gait impairment (781.2).4.  urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).5.  dementia.6.  hypertension.7.  hypercholesterolemia.8.  diabetes. plan:  i had a long conversation with him and his family.  i explained how the symptoms raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific.  i also explained how the appearance of the ventricles on the mri scan raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific for.  i also described the evidence on the mri scan of the long-term effects of his vascular risk factors and explained to his family that these can cause a clinical syndrome that is virtually identical to hydrocephalus.  i explained that it is possible for patients to have both and the best way to determine whether he has hydrocephalus, and more specifically whether he would benefit from shunt surgery is to undertake a test with temporary removal of spinal fluid.  i reviewed both our outpatient lumbar puncture approach and our inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  i gave them a printed description of the inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  his daughter tape-recorded our discussions, so that they can review this. we did review the specific risk of 2% to 3% chance of infection associated with the spinal catheter protocol.  i told them that this is not an emergency and they can take the time to review the details and to contact our office if they have any questions, or if they would like to proceed with testing.",170
"history:  neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  the patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  she had been previously followed by xyz, but has been under the care of the ucsf epilepsy program and recently by dr. y.  i reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at chcc and also interviewed mom. the patient had seizure breakthrough in august 2007, which requires inpatient admission, thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early december.  she remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with diastat.  she presented to our er today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of diastat at home.  mom documented 103 temperature at home.  in the er, this was 101 to 102 degrees fahrenheit.  i reviewed the er notes.  at 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  ucsf fellow was contacted.  she was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  vital weight was 27.  seizures apparently had stopped.  the valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  according to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal cmp. previous workup here showed an eeg on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  mri on june 2007 and january 2005 were within normal limits.  mom describes the following seizure types:1.  eye blinking with unresponsiveness.2.  staring off to one side.3.  focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure. she also said that she was supposed to see dr. y this friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  she was being to physicians&#8217; care as dr. z had previously being following her last ucsf. she had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  these include keppra, lamictal, trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  these are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension. she also had been treated with clobazam.  her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and tranxene.  other attempts to taper topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  she also has oligohidrosis during this summertime. current medications:  include diastat 20 mg; topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day. physical examination:vital signs:  weight 15 kg.general:  the patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.neck:  supple.neurological:  she had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed. she was able to follow commands such as when i request that she gave mom a kiss.  she acknowledged her doll.  left fundus is sharp.  she resisted the rest of the exam.  there was no obvious lateralized findings. assessment:  status epilepticus resolved.  triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy. impression:  i discussed the maximizing depakote to mom and she concurred.  i recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  for today, she did give an iv depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued iv until she is taking p.o.  dr. x agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  she can continue her current doses of topamax and tranxene.  this can be given by ng if needed.  topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  i will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  mom will call contact dr. y an update him about the recent changes.",171
"procedure performed:  dddr permanent pacemaker. indication:  tachybrady syndrome. procedure:  after all risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization suite where the right subclavian region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the left subclavian vein.  once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18-gauze argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein.  a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  the needle was then removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was secured to the field.  a second #18 gauze argon needle was used to cannulate the left subclavian vein and once again a steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  likewise, the needle was removed over the guidewire and the guidewire was then secured to the field.  next, a #15-knife blade was used to make a 1 to 1.5 inch linear incision over the area.  a #11-knife blade was used to make a deeper incision.  hemostasis was made complete.  the edges of the incision were grasped and retracted.  using metzenbaum scissors, dissection was carried down to the pectoralis muscle fascial plane.  digital blunt dissection was used to make a pacemaker pocket large enough to accommodate the pacemaker generator.  metzenbaum scissors were then used to dissect cephalad to expose the guide wires.  the guidewires were then pulled through the pacemaker pocket.  one guidewire was secured to the field. a bloodless introducer sheath was then advanced over a guidewire into the vascular lumen under fluoroscopic guidance.  the guidewire and dilator were then removed.  next, a ventricular pacemaker lead was advanced through the sheath and into the vascular lumen and under fluoroscopic guidance guided down into the right atrium.  the pacemaker lead was then placed in the appropriate position in the right ventricle.  pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  the lead was sewn at the pectoralis muscle plane using #2-0 silk suture in an interrupted stitch fashion around the ________.  pacing and sensing threshold were then reconfirmed.  next, a second bloodless introducer sheath was advanced over the second guidewire into the vascular lumen.  the guidewire and dilator were then removed.  under fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was passed into the right atrium.  the sheath was then turned away in standard fashion.  using fluoroscopic guidance, the atrial lead was then placed in the appropriate position.  pacing and sensing thresholds were obtained.  the lead was sewn to the pectoralis muscle facial plane utilizing #2-0 silk suture around the ________.  sensing and pacing thresholds were then reconfirmed.  the leads were wiped free of blood and placed into the pacemaker generator.  the pacemaker generator leads were then placed into pocket with the leads posteriorly.  the deep tissues were closed utilizing #2-0 chromic suture in an interrupted stitch fashion.  a #4-0 undyed vicryl was then used to close the subcutaneous tissue in a continuous subcuticular stitch.  steri-strips overlaid.  a sterile gauge dressing was placed over the site.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac catheterization room in stable and satisfactory condition. pacemaker data (generator data):manufacturer:  medtronics.model:  sigma.model #:  sdr203b.serial #:  123456789. lead information:right atrial lead:manufacturer:  medtronics.model #:  4568.serial #:  123456789. ventricular lead:manufacturer:  medtronics.model #:  509252.serial #:  123456789. pacing and sensing thresholds:right atrial bipolar lead:  pulse width 0.50 milliseconds, impedance 518 ohms, p-wave sensing 2.2 millivolts, polarity is bipolar. ventricular bipolar lead:  pulse width 0.50 milliseconds, voltage 0.7 volts, current 1.5 milliamps, impedance 655 ohms, r-wave sensing 9.7 millivolts, polarity is bipolar. parameter settings:  pacing mode dddr:  mode switch is on, low rate 60, upper 120, ________ is 33.0 milliseconds. impression:  successful implantation of dddr permanent pacemaker. plan:1.  the patient will be monitored on telemetry for 24 hours to ensure adequate pacemaker function.2.  the patient will be placed on antibiotics for five days to avoid pacemaker infection.",172
"history of present illness:  the patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  i asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  he first mentioned that he has neck pain.  he states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  it is worse with movement.  it has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  it is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  he also endorses a history of gait instability.  this has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  he describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and &quot;walks like a duck.&quot;  he has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. he also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  when i asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  left is slightly more affected than the right.  he denies any tingling or paresthesias.  he also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  he thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  this has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  he has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  he also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  he does have a history of chronic low back pain. at the end of the visit, when i asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  he did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  when i asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  he basically lays in bed all day everyday.  i asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  he is unsure if this is optimally treated.  as i just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  he does not think that he is necessarily sad.  his appetite is good.  he has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. when i took his history, i noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  i asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at johns hopkins a couple of years ago.  he states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. when i asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw dr. x several years ago.  he believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  he told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after dr. y referred him for this evaluation.  he also saw dr. z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  he reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time. past medical history:  he has had diabetes for five years.  he also has had hypercholesterolemia.  he has had crohn&#8217;s disease for 25 or 30 years.  he has had a colostomy for four years.  he has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the crohn&#8217;s disease.  he has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement.  he has depression.  he had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago. current medications:  he takes actos, ambien, baby aspirin, coreg, entocort, folic acid, flomax, iron, lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., lipitor, pentasa, plavix, protonix, toprol, celebrex and zetia. allergies:  he states that imuran caused him to develop tachycardia. social history:  he previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years.  he is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability.  he has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago.  he denies alcohol or illicit drug use.  he lives with his wife.  he does not really have any hobbies. family history:  his father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49.  his mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure.  he has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago.  he has another sister with diabetes.  he has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia.  he is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders. review of systems:  he has dyspnea on exertion.  he states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation.  he has occasional night sweats.  his hearing is poor.  he occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his crohn&#8217;s disease.  he also was diagnosed with sleep apnea.  he does not wear his cpap machine on a regular basis.  he has a history of anemia.  otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  this is documented in the handwritten notes from today&#8217;s visit. physical examination:vital signs:  blood pressure 160/86 hr 100 rr 16 wt 211 pounds pain 3/10general appearance:  he is well appearing in no acute distress.  he has somewhat of a flat affect.cardiovascular:  he has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  there are no carotid bruits.chest:  the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.skin:  there are no rashes or lesions.musculoskeletal:  he has no joint deformities or scoliosis. neurological examination:mental status:  his speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  he is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact.  he has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes. cranial nerves:  pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  visual fields are full.  optic discs are normal.  extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  facial sensation is normal.  there is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  hearing is grossly intact.  shoulder shrug is full. motor:  he has normal muscle bulk and tone.  there is no atrophy.  he has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally.  manual muscle testing reveals mrc grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.  there is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. sensory:  he has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe.  this is diminished at the right toe.  joint position sense is intact.  there is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally.  pinprick is intact.  romberg is absent.  there is no spinal sensory level. coordination:  this is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.  he does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms. deep tendon reflexes:  they are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles.  plantar reflexes are flexor.  there is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or hoffman&#8217;s signs.  he has crossed adductors bilaterally. gait and stance:  he has a slightly wide-based gait.  he has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.  he has difficulty with toe raises on the left. radiologic data:  mri of the cervical spine, 09/30/08:  chronic spondylosis at c5-c6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal.  spondylosis of c6-c7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression. thoracic mri spine without contrast:  minor degenerative changes without stenosis. i do not have the mri of the lumbar spine available to review. laboratory data:  10/07/08:  vitamin b1 210 (87-280), vitamin b6 6, esr 6, ast 25, alt 17, vitamin b12 905, cpk 226 (0-200), t4 0.85, tsh 3.94, magnesium 1.7, rpr nonreactive, crp 4, lyme antibody negative, spep abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin a1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0. assessment:  the patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue.  his neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  he has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks. i think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  he probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  he really is most concerned about the fatigue and i think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen. recommendations:1.  i scheduled him for repeat emg and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.2.  i will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although i am confident in dr. z&#8217;s opinion that there is no surgical indication.3.  i gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.4.  i believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  it may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but i will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  the patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.5.  he does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.  he states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well.  this should also be addressed.6.  i also am checking another cpk to see if there is any elevation.",173
"this is a middle-aged male with increasing memory loss and history of lyme disease. findings:there is a large intrasellar mass lesion producing diffuse expansion of the sella turcica. this mass lesions measures approximately 16 x 18 x 18mm (craniocaudal x ap x mediolateral) in size.   the lesion extends into the left cavernous sinus along the inferior edge of the c3 segment of the left cavernous carotid artery obscuring the left cranial nerves iii, iv and vi. the v1 and v2 branches however can be identified. there is intense enhancement of this lesion following gadolinium augmentation. there is a focal central area of nonenhancement which measures approximately 4mm in diameter. there is right-sided deviation of the infundibulum with mild convex bowing of this mass lesion into the suprasellar cistern, however, there is no impingement upon the optic chiasm. there is pressure erosion of the floor of the sella turcica bulging into the sphenoid sinus without a demonstrated cortical destruction or invasion of the sphenoid sinus. the lesion most likely represents a macroadenoma. the intense enhancement of the central area of hypointense signal raises the possibility a calcification suggesting a differential diagnosis of a late onset craniopharyngioma. the lesion is not considered consistent with a meningioma. ct imaging would be of benefit for exclusion of calcification. normal flow within the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation and there is no demonstrated aneurysm of the circle of willis. normal cerebral hemispheres and normal cortical gray matter and white matter tracks. there are no white matter hyperintensities. there is normal enhancement of the dural sinuses and cortical veins. there is no enhancing intraaxial or extraaxial mass lesion. normal basal ganglia and thalami. normal internal and external capsules. normal midbrain, pons and medulla and a normal brainstem cervical cord junction. normal vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. normal calvarium. there is a 1.5cm retention cyst of the posterior wall of the left maxillary antrum. the paranasal sinuses are normal. normal temporal bones. normal central skull base. normal clivus and craniovertebral junction. impression:large intrasellar mass lesion with probable invasion of the left cavernous sinus. see above for size, morphology and pattern of enhancement. differential considerations include a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland versus a craniopharyngioma. ct imaging is recommended for assessment of possible calcifications. retention cyst of the left maxillary antrum. normal supratentorial brainstem and posterior fossa.",174

reconstruction with autologous graft.4.  advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.5.  barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones. anesthesia:  general. procedure:  after induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  scalp was clipped.  he was prepped with chloraprep.  incision was infiltrated with 0.5% xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner. a bicoronal zigzag incision was made and raney clips used for hemostasis.  subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  these were subgaleal flaps.  bipolar and bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  the craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  the pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy. paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  one was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  there was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes. the dura was separated with a #4 penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  i should say with the midas rex drill using the v5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled. the wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation. the next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  osteotomies were made with the midas rex drill using the v5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  this was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  midas rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  the osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  bone wax was used for hemostasis.  it was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  so we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  this was done with the midas rex drill using b5 bit.  also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the midas rex drill.  the osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  at this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally. dr. x cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and i fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  this created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  the posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly. the left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place. holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for isaac. at this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 vicryl suture.  this helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region. also, i separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly. at this point, gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure. the wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 ml and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma. at this point, the reconstruction looked good.  the advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  the wound was irrigated and then the gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  the patient tolerated procedure well.  no complications.  sponge and needle counts were correct.  again, blood loss was bout 300 to 400 ml and he received 2 units of blood and some fresh frozen plasma.",186

"history:  the patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  he also has vacterl association with hydrocephalus.  as an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  on 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, pda ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  on 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  a repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  he then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  blood pressures were found to be 13 mmhg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 wood units.  on 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  a repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent fontan fenestration and intolerance of fontan fenestration occlusion.  the patient then followed conservatively since that time.  the patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract. procedure:  after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures. using a 7-french sheath, a 6-french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  this catheter was then exchanged for a 5-french vs catheter of a distal wire.  apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  the wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle. using a 5-french sheath, a 5-french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  the catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  a balloon valvoplasty was performed using a ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-french flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  there was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  the balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety. echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  a final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  attention was then directed to a fontan fenestration.  a balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in fontan pressures from 12 mmhg to 15 mmhg.  with less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  the angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  a 7-french flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  a 10-mm amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated. flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  there was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  left pulmonary veins were not entered.  there was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the fontan fenestration.  mean fontan pressures were 12 mmhg with a 1 mmhg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an a-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmhg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic flow was normal.  pulmonary flow was reduced to the qt-qs ratio of 0.7621.  pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 wood units. angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  the left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  there was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the glenn anastomosis and the fontan anastomosis.  there was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  a large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  there is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  the branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  angiogram with injection in the fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries. following the device occlusion of fontan fenestration, the fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmhg with a 3 mmhg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  there was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  the calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a qt-qs ratio of 0.921.  angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the fontan with no protrusion into the fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a fontan flow.  an ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.  a small degree of contrast returned to the heart. initial diagnoses:  1.  pulmonary atresia.2.  vacterl association.3.  persistent sinusoidal right ventricle to the coronary

"cc: horizontal diplopia. hx:  this 67 y/orhm first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the neurology clinic. the diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. during this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. he received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. he did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. the diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. it resolves when he covers one eye. it is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. there are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia. pmh: 1)4vessel cabg and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)hypercholesterolemia. 3)bipolar affective d/o. fhx: htn, colon ca, and a daughter with unknown type of &quot;dystonia.&quot; shx: denied tobacco/etoh/illicit drug use. ros: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/cp/sob. he occasionally experiences bilateral lower extremity cramping (?claudication) after walking for prolonged periods. meds: lithium 300mg bid, accupril 20mg bid, cellufresh ophthalmologic tears, asa 325mg qd. exam: bp216/108 hr72 rr14 wt81.6kg t36.6c ms: unremarkable. cn: horizontal binocular diplopia on lateral gaze in both directions. no other cn deficits noted. motor: 5/5 full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. sensory: unremarkable. coord: mild &quot;ataxia&quot; of ram (left &gt; right) station: no pronator drift or romberg sign gait: unremarkable. reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion) studies/course: gen screen: unremarkable. brain ct revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. this shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. there are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. the midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. the long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma). no surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. he was lost to follow-up in 1993.",224
"procedure:  esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy. indications for procedure:  a 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  it does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  ct scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with crohn&#8217;s disease.  endoscopy is being done to evaluate for crohn&#8217;s disease. medications:  general anesthesia. instrument:  olympus gif-160 and pcf-160. complications:  none. estimated blood loss:  less than 5 ml. findings:  with the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  the endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  the scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  it appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  the endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  rugal folds were flattened completely.  there were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with crohn&#8217;s involvement of the stomach.  the endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for clo testing.  excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  the scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well. the patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o&#8217;clock.  the colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  the colonic clean out was excellent.  the scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  the cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  the ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  the colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  no fistulas were noted in the colon.  excess air was evacuated from the colon.  the scope was removed.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition. impression:  normal esophagus and duodenum.  there were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  all these findings are consistent with crohn&#8217;s disease. plan:  begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  await ppd results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  if these are normal, then we would recommend remicade 5 mg/kg iv infusion.  we would start modulon 50 ml/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  check cmp and phosphate every monday, wednesday, and friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  we will discuss with dr. x possibly repeating the ct fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  he will need an upper gi to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  if he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with crohn&#8217;s in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.",225

"after going to see the patient at approximately 1 a.m. for tachypnea, the patient was noted to be sating 99 to 100% on face shield.  he was calm and his respiratory rate was approximately 20.  after discussion with the rapid response nurse, it was decided that we will watch him in his bed in our return to rounds on other patients.  approximately 30 minutes later, i heard over the hospital intercom there was code blue in mr. x&#8217;s room and i rapidly proceeded to his room and found the patient undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  he was being bag masked and chest compressions were being performed.  a quick consultation with his nurse informed me that the patient was sating 99 to 100%, asked to sit up.  his wife and the nurse helped him sit up.  when he sat up, he apparently vomited and afterwards quickly desatted and his heart rate went to zero, a code blue was called, when i arrived on the scene the crash cart was being moved into position, i helped the nurses attach the monitoring leads and defibrillation pads on the patient.  after, the pads were attached, we assessed his rhythm and found him to be in ventricular fibrillation.  i ordered a defibrillation at 120, which was followed by 2 minutes of cpr.  during 2 minutes cpr, one of epinephrine and one of atropine was given.  during this time, he was being bag mask ventilated and an anesthesiologist was consulted to gain a definitive airway.  on reassessment of rhythm, the patient was found to be asystolic and no pulse was felt in his femoral or carotid arteries.  cpr was continued again and another round of epinephrine and atropine were given.  during this time, the anesthesiologist arrived and an et tube was placed with positive co2 return and breath sounds were heard in both lungs bilaterally.  cpr was continued for approximately 20 minutes with a total of five of epinephrine, 3 of atropine, 2 bicarb, 1 of calcium, and 1 of magnesium being given.  he had positive ventilation during this time with bilateral breath sounds being monitored at each rhythm check in two-minute intervals between cpr.  after approximately 25 minutes, a junctional rhythm was seen on the monitor and the patient was found to have a weak pulse.  the pulse was soon lost and cpr was continued.  at the next evaluation between cpr, the patient was found to be back in atrial fibrillation with a positive pulse in his carotid, femoral and radial arteries.  at this time, the patient he was transported to the icu.  when the patient was transported to the icu, dr. a secondary resident and b, fifth year resident arrived on the seen and took over the running of the code.  in the icu, his cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continued for approximately 20 more minutes after rhythm was lost.  rhythm was eventually regained and arterial line was introduced that found good waveform and pressures.  the patient was in atrial fibrillation/flutter.  again, he was placed on epinephrine drip.  labs were sent and post resuscitation chest x-ray was ordered.",227
"preoperative diagnoses:  1.  congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.2.  rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak. postoperative diagnoses:  diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia. anesthesia:  general. indication:  the patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  last week, dr. x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  dr. x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  this was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  we met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt. operative findings:  the patient&#8217;s abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient&#8217;s small bowel would be viable surgical option.  instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that. the lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  they were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  they were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well. description of operation:  the patient was brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  we conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient&#8217;s important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  as the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  the bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient&#8217;s chylous ascites.  the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient&#8217;s abdominal incision with 4-0 pds on the posterior sheath and 3-0 pds on the anterior rectus sheath.  subcuticular 5-0 monocryl and steri-strips were used for skin closure. the patient tolerated the procedure well.  he lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 ml of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an intestinal transplantation center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.",228

"reason for referral:  the patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope. brief summary &#038; impressions: relevant history:historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with the patient. the patient presented to dr. x on august 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  she was referred to dr. x for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  the patient reports an extensive neurological history.  her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  in spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved &quot;honors in school&quot; and &quot;looked smart.&quot;  she reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  at 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  she reported that she will frequently &quot;bang her head against the wall&quot; to relieve the pain.  the patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  at 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  she reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and &quot;thrown two and a half city blocks.&quot;  the patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  she reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  in 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  these episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma. the patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  she reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  these episodes diminished from 2002 to june 2008.  when making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  she reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  a second episode occurred on july 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  she was admitted to sinai hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  her eeg and head ct were considered to be completely normal.  she did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour eeg.  she reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  she stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and &quot;tunnel vision&quot; (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was &quot;spazzing out&quot; on the floor.  during these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding. the patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  she reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of jack daniel.  she stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  in 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  the patient&#8217;s medical history is also significant for postpartum depression. the patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  she reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  she finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  she experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  she reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  she said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  at the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  the patient is living with her biological mother.  although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful.  she reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them. at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient&#8217;s medication included ativan, imitrex, levoxyl, vitamin b12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and zofran as needed.  (it should be noted that the patient by the time of the feedback on september 19, 2008 had resumed taking her trileptal for bipolar disorder.).  the patient&#8217;s familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. tests administered:clinical interviewcognistatmattis dementia rating scalewechsler adult intelligence scale &#8211;

visual-motor function:  on a visual spatial discrimination task, her performance fell solidly in the average range.  on a measure of fine motor manual dexterity, her right hand and left hand performance fell in the average range and when she was required to use both hands simultaneously, her performance decreased slightly into the low average range. learning &#038; memory skills:  on a five-trial 16-item verbal list learning measure, the patient&#8217;s rate of acquisition fell in the high average range.  when a interference list was introduced, she had some difficulty learning the interference list as she could only recall 25% of the words.  however, following the introduction of this list, she was still able to recall 15 of the 16 words from the original list.  following a 20-minute delay, she was able to recall 15 of the 16 words.  she entirely used a semantic cluster strategy.  overall, her performance fell in the high average range on this measure.  on a story (prose) verbal memory measure, her immediate and delayed (30 minute) recall both fell in the high average range. on the copy of the complex geometric design, her visual spatial organization was poor and her performance fell in the low average range.  her immediate recall of the design fell in the borderline range and following a 30-minute delay, she lost even more details to decline into the mildly impaired range.  in general, her copy of the design was notable for its lack of overall configuration and good stop.  her immediate recall failed to maintain a good stop overall configuration design and was void of details.  the design further decompensated after a 30-minute delay as she lost further configuration and details.  it is thought that her poor performance on this could represent some difficulty in visual memory, but most likely is due to poor initial encoding and organization of the design.  on facial recognition task, her immediate recognition of the faces fell in the high average range.  following a 30-minute delay, though her performance declined to the low end of average, this is a significant discrepancy and suggested that she did have difficulty retaining and retrieving the information that she had stored.  therefore, a subtle mild weakness is in visual spatial memory. academic function: behavioral/emotional function:  the patient was administered a mmpi-2.  her responses unfortunately were completely invalid due to an over endorsement of symptoms.  typically, an over endorsement of symptoms is indicative of significant affective distress or a need for attention.  on this measure, the patient reported an elevated level of affective distress and unusual ideation.  her profile is consistent with patients who may demonstrate their affective distress through physical means.  overall, this pattern should be interpreted very cautiously due to the invalid nature of the profile. summary &#038; impressions:  the patient was referred by neurologist for a neuropsychological evaluation for diagnostic clarity, and specific recommendations for medical and psychological intervention in light of undiagnosed episodes of syncope. in summary, the patient&#8217;s neuropsychological evaluation revealed selective deficits of executive system dysfunction, mild receptive language difficulties (partially due to executive system dysfunction) and subtle visual memory storage and retrieval superimposed upon an average level of intellect.  her mmpi-2 was invalid, but indicated that she was undergoing significant stress and that she is more likely to demonstrate her stress through physical and cognitive rather than emotional display. the patient&#8217;s neurobehavioral risk factors are significant for chronic history of migraines, bipolar disorder, depression, reported in utero exposure to alcohol, history of heavy substance abuse, and use of neuropsychiatric medication.  bipolar affective disorder is known to impact executive system dysfunction as patients have difficulty with impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, working memory, emotional control, and self-monitoring.  the patient&#8217;s performance is certainly consistent with this report.  medication can also have an effect on executive system functioning and attention/concentration.  despite this, it is far better for her to have access to neuropsychiatric medication to balance her mood swings.  there was some mild evidence of decreased visual spatial memory for retrieval in contrast to high average verbal memory.  although she had difficulty on measures of comprehension, it was likely due to decreased attention and concentration given that she was able to perform other tasks that require receptive language very well (verbal memory).  given the patient&#8217;s history, she has done extraordinarily well and many of her cognitive abilities are intact, which allow her to function at a very high level.  it is strongly recommended that she share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist to assist in any treatment planning for her and to continue to make positive and achievable goals for the patient. you may wish to consider the following recommendations to improve the patient&#8217;s quality of life. recommendations:medical:1.  please share these results with dr. x to determine any need to change in her medical treatment.2.  it is critical that the patient take care of herself and reduce her distress.  in particular, she should make sure that she has a normalized sleeping pattern and she is eating appropriately and getting appropriate rest.psychological:1.  she should share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist, to assess for any change in her current psychological treatment.2.  it is likely that the patient will need to stay on medication to treat her bipolar disorder.  bipolar disorder does not go into remission and sadly is a chronic disorder.3.  in psychotherapy, it is important for goals to be set for the patient and that she can achieve those goals.  it is apparent that she is frequently feeling overwhelmed and does not understand how to be able to take care of herself and ways that are not needing medical care.  goals to increase her sleep and reduce her stress may be fundamental, but are certainly required in her case. occupational:  the patient has many strong abilities and with balance of her emotional life, there is no reason why she cannot return to work.  her work setting should be in a well structured place with minimal multitasking and will keep a people contact.",235

"title of operation:  right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage. indication for surgery:  the patient is very well known to our service.  in brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  he was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  the brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the intensive care unit and then was taken to the ct scan, developed a second seizure.  he was given ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  i had a long discussion immediately with dr. x and dr. y.  we decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  it worried me and i think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  the patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  the original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  he was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma. preop diagnosis:  pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage. postop diagnosis:  intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach. anesthesia:  general. procedure in detail:  the patient was taken to the operating room.  in the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  the patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  the surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  at this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  we went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  we went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  we immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  so i went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  so we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  we went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  the brain was very relaxed.  we had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  we irrigated thoroughly.  we identified the ventricles.  we went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with avitene with thrombin and gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  all this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with surgicel, and the surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  we went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  we had done a pericranial flap.  this was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 surgilons.  we reconstructed everything.  the frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  we went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of duragen with hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  in summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  so everything was stable.  estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  the sponges and needle counts were correct.  no specimens were sent to pathology. disposition:  the patient after this procedure was brought to the neuro intensive care unit for close observation.",237

"re:  sample patient dear sample doctor: thank you for referring mr. sample patient for cardiac evaluation.  this is a 67-year-old, obese male who has a history of therapy-controlled hypertension, borderline diabetes, and obesity.  he has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance.  specifically, no chest discomfort of any kind, no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed, no orthopnea or pnd.  he is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease.  he has never been a smoker.  he has never had a syncopal episode, mi, or cva.  he had his gallbladder removed.  no bleeding tendencies.  no history of dvt or pulmonary embolism.  the patient is retired, rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately.  he apparently has a sleep disorder, according to his wife (not in the office), the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep.  he is allergic to codeine and aspirin (angioedema). physical exam revealed a middle-aged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches.  his heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular.  his blood pressure was 140/80 mmhg in the right arm in a sitting position and 150/80 mmhg in a standing position.  he is in no distress.  venous pressure is normal.  carotid pulsations are normal without bruits.  the lungs are clear.  cardiac exam was normal.  the abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated.  there were no pulsatile masses or bruits.  the femoral pulses were 3+ in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3+ in character.  there was no peripheral edema.   he had a chemistry profile, which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mg/dl.  renal function was normal.  his lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and hdl and an acceptable range of ldl.  his sodium was a little bit increased.  his a1c hemoglobin was increased.  he had a spirometry, which was reported as normal.   he had a resting electrocardiogram on december 20, 2002, which was also normal.  he had a treadmill cardiolite, which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90% of the predicted maximum heart rate.  there were no symptoms or ischemia by ekg.  there was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by cardiolite imaging. in summary, we have a 67-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease.  i am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity, hypertension, possible insulin resistance, and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia, as well as slight triglyceride elevation.  he denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease, but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis, possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings.   in view of the absence of symptoms, medical therapy is indicated at the present time, with very aggressive risk factor modification.  i explained and discussed extensively with the patient, the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient.  he also should start aggressively losing weight.  i have requested additional testing today, which will include an apolipoprotein b, lpa lipoprotein, as well as homocystine, and cardio crp to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis.   in terms of medication, i have changed his verapamil for a long acting beta-blocker, he should continue on an ace inhibitor and his plavix.  the patient is allergic to aspirin.  i also will probably start him on a statin, if any of the studies that i have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore, if he is confirmed to have diabetes.  along this line, perhaps, we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes, which i believe he should.  this, however, i will leave entirely up to you to decide.  if indeed, he is considered to be a diabetic, a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general, and coronary artery disease in particular. i do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing, such as coronary angiography, in the absence of symptoms. if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to let me know. thank you once again for this kind referral. sincerely, sample doctor, m.d.",277

"history:  the patient is a 5-1/2-year-old with down syndrome, complex heart disease consisting of atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia, discontinuous pulmonary arteries and bilateral superior vena cava with a left cava draining to the coronary sinus and a right aortic arch.  as an infant, he was initially palliated with the right and modified blalock-taussig shunt in october of 2002 and underwent atrioventricular septal defect and repair of pulmonary artery unifocalization and homograft placement between the right ventricle and unifocalized pulmonary arteries.  he developed a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis for which on 07/20/2004, he underwent a bilateral balloon pulmonary arterioplasty and stent implantation at the san diego at children&#8217;s hospital.  this was followed on 09/13/2007 with replacement of pulmonary valve utilizing a 16-mm contegra valve.  a recent echocardiogram demonstrated a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis with the predicted gradient of 41 to 55 mmhg and a well-functioning contegra valve.  the lung perfusion scan from 11/14/2007 demonstrated 47% flow to the left lung and 53% flow to the right lung.  the patient underwent a repeat catheterization in consideration for further balloon angioplasty of the branch pulmonary arteries. procedure:  after sedation, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing 50% oxygen throughout the case.  the patient was prepped and draped.  cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures using a 7-french sheath, 6-french wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  this catheter was exchanged over wire.  a 5-french marker pigtail catheter was directed into the main pulmonary artery.  a second site of venous access was achieved in and the left femoral vein with the placement of 5-french sheath. using a 4-french sheath, a 4-french pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta and left ventricle.  angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery demonstrated stable stent configuration of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries with intimal ingrowth in the region of the proximal stents.  the distal right pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent section measuring 9.4 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the right pulmonary artery of 5.80 mm.  the distal left pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent measuring 10.3 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the left pulmonary artery is 6.8 mm diameter.  the left femoral venous sheath was exchanged over wire for a 7-french sheath.  guidewires were then advanced through the respective venous sheath into the branch pulmonary arteries and simultaneous balloon pulmonary arterioplasty was performed using the two z-med 12 x 4 cm balloon catheter was advanced into the branch of pulmonary arteries and inflated maximally to 9 hemispheres of pressure on 5 occasions near complete disappearance of proximal waist.  the balloon catheter was then exchanged for a 5-french mistique catheter for pressure pull-back and measurement in the angiogram.  the catheter&#8217;s wires were then removed and final hemodynamic assessment was made with the wedge catheter. flows were calculated by the fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with angiograph injection in the main pulmonary artery. after angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  there were no complications. discussion:  oxygen consumption was assumed to be in normal.  mixed venous saturation that was not normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  left side of the heart was mildly desaturated following a part to parenchymal lung disease with the partial pressure of oxygen of only 82 mmhg.  aphasic right atrial pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  left ventricular systolic pressure was moderately elevated at 70% of systemic level and there was no obstruction into the proximal main pulmonary artery.  there was a 20 mmhg of peak systolic gradient across the branch pulmonary artery stents to the distal artery.  right and left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an a-wave similar to the mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 13 mmhg.  left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic.  no outflow constriction to the ascending aorta.  phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  the calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  vascular resistances were normal.  angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency, well functioning contegra valve with no appreciable calcification.  the proximal narrowing of the distal main pulmonary artery was appreciated.  neointimal ingrowth within the proximal stents were appreciated.  there is good distal growth of the pulmonary arteries.  arborization appeared normal.  levophase contrast returned to the heart appeared normal with a well-functioning left ventricle and the right aortic arch.  following the branch pulmonary artery angioplasty that was increased in the mixed venous saturation, as well as an increase in the systemic arterial saturation.  right ventricular systolic pressure felt slightly to 40 mmhg with an increase in systemic arterial pressure with a systolic pressure ratio of 54%.  the main pulmonary pressures remained similar.  there was 10 mmhg systolic gradient into the branch of pulmonary arteries.  there is an increase in distal branch of pulmonary arteries with the mean pressure increased from 16 mmhg to 21 mmhg.  final angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed a competent contegra valve.  a brisk flow through the proximal branch stents with the improved caliber of the branch pulmonary artery lumens.  there was no evidence of intimal disruption.

"procedure performed:1. left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.2. right femoral selective angiogram.3. closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an angio-seal. indications for procedure: the patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. she has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. the decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression. description of procedure: after informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. she was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. then, a 6-french sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-french jl4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. a 6-french jr4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. subsequently, a 6-french angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 ml per second for a total of 30 ml. at the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. as such, an initial attempt to advance a perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. as such, the perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. we then replaced this with a 6-french angio-seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. the patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the mac unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home. hemodynamic data: opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. there was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. there was normal wall motion in the rao projection. coronary angiogram: the left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. the proximal lad was 100% occluded. the left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. the obtuse marginal branch which operates as an om-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. this appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the om. this is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. the right coronary artery is dominant. the native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. the distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. the posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. the proximal pda has a 40 to 50% stenosis. the saphenous vein graft to the right pda is widely patent. there was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the pda. the runoff from the pda is nice with the native proximal pda and plv disease as noted above. there is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. the lad beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. there is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004. conclusion: 100% proximal lad mild left circumflex disease with an om that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. the native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate plv and pda disease. the saphenous vein graft to the om is known to be 100% occluded. the saphenous vein graft to the pda and the saphenous vein graft to the lad are open. normal left ventricular systolic function. plan: the plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. the patient&#8217;s goal ldl will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking. after her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month. we will also plan to perform a carotid duplex doppler ultrasound to evaluate her carotid bruits.",283
"2-d echocardiogram multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.  cardiac function is normal.  there is no significant chamber enlargement or hypertrophy.  there is no pericardial effusion or vegetations seen.  doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow.  pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve.  pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium.  the interatrial septum is intact.  mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal.  the aortic valve is trileaflet.  the coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins.  the aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.",284
"preoperative diagnoses:  colon cancer screening and family history of polyps. postoperative diagnosis:  colonic polyps. procedure:  colonoscopy. anesthesia:  mac description of procedure:  the olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum.  the preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  the mucosa was normal throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum.  two polyps were identified and were removed.  the first was a 7-mm sessile lesion in the mid transverse colon at 110 cm, removed with the snare without cautery and retrieved.  the second was a small 4-mm sessile lesion in the sigmoid colon at 20 cm also removed with the snare and retrieved.  no other lesions were identified.  numerous diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon.  a retroflex through the anorectal junction showed moderate internal hemorrhoids.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. final diagnoses:1.  sigmoid diverticulosis.2.  colonic polyps in the transverse colon and sigmoid colon, benign appearance, removed.3.  internal hemorrhoids.4.  otherwise normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum. recommendations:1.  follow up biopsy report.2.  follow up with dr. x as needed.3.  screening colonoscopy in 5 years.",285

problem, disorientation and bizarre behaviors.  at this time, mr. abc is experiencing some mood disturbance.  it appears that this might be secondary to his health problems but given the claimant&#8217;s tendencies to minimize his mental health symptoms and to fail to give adequate historical details, it is difficult to know for sure.  based on presentation, intellectually and cognitively, it is believed that mr. abc could not complete work-related tasks satisfactorily.  emotionally and socially, it is believed that he could not tolerate work stressors and could not adjust to a work environment and schedule.  at this time, it is believed that his cognitive dysfunction would be a hindrance to him in a work setting.   capability:  if mr. abc were to receive benefits, it

after the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, an informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  a steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  a small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held.  the needle was removed over the guidewire.  a #6 french sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  the guidewire and dilator were then removed.  the sheath was then flushed.  next, angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  the catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle.  the guidewire was then removed.  the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  lvedp was then measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  the left ventriculogram was performed in the rao position with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  lvedp was then remeasured.  pullback was then performed, which failed to reveal an lvao gradient.  the catheter was then removed.  next, a judkins left #4

removed.  next, a judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  the guidewire was removed.  the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  the ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  the saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views.  the judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was retracted.  we were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire.  next, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire.  the wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery.  the multipurpose catheter was then removed.  lima catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery.  the guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  lima graft was then engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  the lima graft was evaluated in several different views.  once adequate study has been performed, the lima catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance.  the sheath was flushed for the final time.  the patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition. findings:left ventriculogram:  there is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 24 mmhg preinjection and 26 mmhg postinjection.  there is no mitral regurgitation.  there is no lvao or pullback. left main coronary artery:  the left main is a moderate caliber vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  there is no evidence of any hemodynamically significant stenosis. left anterior descending artery:  the lad is a small caliber vessel, which traverses through the intraventricular groove and wraps around the apex of the heart.  there are luminal irregularities from the mid to distal portion.  there is noted to be antegrade flow in the lima to lad graft.  there are very small diagonal branches, which are diffusely diseased. circumflex artery:  the circumflex is a small caliber vessel, which traverses through the atrioventricular groove.  there are minor luminal irregularities throughout.  there are very small obtuse marginal branches, which are diffusely diseased. right coronary artery:  the rca is a small vessel with luminal irregularities throughout.  the rca is the dominant coronary artery. left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery failed to demonstrate any hemodynamically significant stenosis.  saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branches is a y-graft, which bifurcates to the first obtuse marginal and the obtuse marginal branch.  the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branches is widely patent without any evidence of hemodynamically significant disease. impression:1.  diffusely diseased native vessels.2.  saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch is widely patent.3.  left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery is patent.4.  normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 60%.5.  mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures. plan:1.  the patient is to continue on her current medical regimen, which includes beta-blocker, aspirin, statin, and plavix.  the patient is unable to tolerate a long-acting nitrate, thus this will be discontinued.2.  we will add norvasc 5 mg daily as well as hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.3.  risk factor modification was discussed with the patient including diet control as well as tobacco cessation.4.  the patient will need to be monitored closely for close lipid control as well as blood pressure control.",310

"procedure:  esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. preoperative diagnosis:  a 1-year-10-month-old with a history of dysphagia to solids.  the procedure was done to rule out organic disease. postoperative diagnoses:  loose lower esophageal sphincter and duodenal ulcers. consent:  the consent is signed. medications:  the procedure was done under general anesthesia given by dr. marino fernandez. complications:  none. procedure in detail:  a history and physical examination were performed, and the procedure, indications, potential complications including bleeding, perforation, the need for surgery, infection, adverse medical reaction, risks, benefits, and alternatives available were explained to the parents, who stated good understanding and consented to go ahead with the procedure.  the opportunity for questions was provided, and informed consent was obtained.  once the consent was obtained, the patient was sedated with iv medications and intubated by dr. fernandez and placed in the supine position.  then, the tip of the xp-160 videoscope was introduced into the oropharynx, and under direct visualization, we could advance the endoscope into the upper, mid, and lower esophagus.  we did not find any strictures in the upper esophagus, but the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter totally loose.  then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the stomach and guided into the pylorus, and then into the first portion of the duodenum.  we noticed that the patient had several ulcers in the first portion of the duodenum.  then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the second portion of the duodenum, one biopsy was taken there, and then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the first portion, and two biopsies were taken there.  then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the antrum, where two biopsies were taken, and one biopsy for clotest.  by retroflexed view, at the level of the body of the stomach, i could see that the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter loose.  finally, the endoscope was unflexed and was brought back to the lower esophagus, where two biopsies were taken.  at the end, air was suctioned from the stomach, and the endoscope was removed out of the patient&#8217;s mouth.  the patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. final impression:  1.  duodenal ulcers.2.  loose lower esophageal sphincter. plan:1.  to start omeprazole 20 mg a day.2.  to review the biopsies.3.  to return the patient back to clinic in 1 to 2 weeks.",312
"angina is chest pain due to a lack of oxygen to the heart most often occurring in men age 35 or older and postmenopausal women.  it is usually located right under the breast bone.  physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on.  in a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled.  in a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn&#8217;t get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles).  other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia.  people more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease. signs and symptoms:*  pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.*  the pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.*  possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.*  occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.*  pain may be located between the shoulder blades. treatment:*  nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds.  carry it with you at all times.*  other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems.  it is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.*  surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.*  correct the contributing factors you have control over.  lose weight, don&#8217;t smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina.  such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren&#8217;t a risk).  practice relaxation techniques.*  exercise! discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.*  even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat.  treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.*  let your doctor know if your angina doesn&#8217;t go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet.  call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps.  if your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.",313
"history of present illness: the patient is known to me secondary to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, partially due to medications, at least when i first saw him in the office on 01/11/06. he is now 77 years old. he is being seen on the seventh floor. the patient is in room 7607. the patient has a history of recent adenocarcinoma of the duodenum that was found to be inoperable, since it engulfed the porta hepatis. the workup began with gi bleeding. he was seen in my office on 01/11/06 for preop evaluation due to leg edema. a nonocclusive dvt was diagnosed in the proximal left superficial femoral vein. both legs were edematous, and bilateral venous insufficiency was also present. an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 50%. the patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with a greenfield filter since anticoagulant was contraindicated. additional information on the echocardiogram, where a grossly dilated left atrium, moderately severely dilated right atrium. the rhythm was, as stated before, atrial fibrillation with slow atrioventricular conduction and an intraventricular conduction delay on the monitor strip. there was mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic insufficiency. the ejection fraction was considered low normal, since it was estimated 50 to 54%. the patient received blood while in the hospital due to anemia. the leg edema improved while lying down, suggesting that the significant element of venous insufficiency was indeed present. the patient, who was diabetic, received consultation by dr. r. he was also a chronic hypertensive and was treated for that with ace inhibitors. the atrial fibrillation was slow, and no digitalis or beta blockers were recommended at the same time. as a matter of fact, they were discontinued. now, the patient denied any shortness of breath or chest pain throughout this hospitalization, and cardiac nuclear studies performed earlier demonstrated no reversible ischemia. allergies: the patient has no known drug allergies. his diabetes was suspected to be complicated with neuropathy due to tingling in both feet. he received his immunizations with flu in 2005 but did not receive pneumovax. social history: the patient is married. he had 1 child who died at the age of 26 months of unknown etiology. he quit smoking 6 years ago but dips (smokeless) tobacco. family history: mother had cancer, died at 70. father died of unknown cause, and brother died of unknown cause. functional capacity: the patient is wheelchair bound at the time of his initial hospitalization. he is currently walking in the corridor with assistance. nocturia twice to 3 times per night. review of systems:ophthalmologic: uses glasses.ent: complains of occasional sinusitis.cardiovascular: hypertension and atrial fibrillation.respiratory: normal.gi: colon bleeding. the patient believes he had ulcers.genitourinary: normal.musculoskeletal: complains of arthritis and gout.integumentary: edema of ankles and joints.neurological: tingling as per above. denies any psychiatric problems.endocrine: diabetes, niddm.hematologic and lymphatic: the patient does not use any aspirin or anticoagulants and is not of anemia. laboratory: current ekg demonstrates atrial fibrillation with incomplete left bundle branch block pattern. q waves are noticed in the inferior leads. nonprogression of the r-wave from v1 to v4 with small r-waves in v5 and v6 are suggestive of an old anterior and inferior infarcts. left ventilator hypertrophy and strain is suspected. physical examination:general: on exam, the patient is alert, oriented and cooperative. he is mildly pale. he is an elderly gentleman who is currently without diaphoresis, pallor, jaundice, plethora, or icterus.vital signs: blood pressure is 159/69 with a respiratory rate of 20, pulse is 67 and irregularly irregular. pulse oximetry is 100.neck: without jvd, bruit, or thyromegaly. the neck is supple.chest: symmetric. there is no heave or retraction.heart: the heart sounds are irregular and no significant murmurs could be auscultated.lungs: clear to auscultation.abdomen: exam was deferred.legs: without edema. pulses: dorsalis pedis pulse was palpated bilaterally. medications: current medications include enalapril, low dose enoxaparin, fentanyl patches. he is no longer on fluconazole. he is on a sliding scale as per dr. holden. he is on lansoprazole (prevacid), toradol, piperacillin/tazobactam, hydralazine p.r.n., zofran, dilaudid, benadryl, and lopressor p.r.n. assessment and plan: the patient is a very pleasant elderly gentleman with intractable/inoperable malignancy. his cardiac issues are chronic and most likely secondary to long term hypertension and diabetes. he has chronic atrial fibrillation. i do not envision a scenario whereby he will become a candidate for management of this arrhythmia beyond weight control. he is also not a candidate for anticoagulation, which is, in essence, a part and parcel of the weight control. reason being is high likelihood for gi bleeding, especially given the diagnosis of invasive malignancy with involvement of multiple organs and lymph nodes. at this point, i agree with the notion of hospice care. if his atrioventricular conduction becomes excessive, occasional nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as diltiazem or beta blockers would be appropriate; otherwise, i would keep him off those medications due to evidence of slow conduction in the presence of digitalis and beta blockers.",314

affect is irritated, angry, demanding, attempting to wrest control from me, depressed, frustrated.  thought is directed.  content is nondelusional.  there are no auditory and no visual hallucinations.  the patient has no homicidal ideation.  the patient does endorse suicidal ideations.  regarding plan, the patient notes that cutting herself hurts too much therefore she would like to take some benzodiazepines or barbiturates but has access to none.  the patient states that she will not try to hurt herself currently and that she poses no risk at present.  the patient notes that she does not want to go to the hospital at present.  the patient is alert and oriented x 3.  recall is three for three at five minutes.  proverbs are concrete.  she has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight. formulation:  the patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning.  the patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression.  the patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states.  the patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant.  she notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets.  the patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy.  the patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.  in addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder.  this latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist&#8217;s absence and departure.  this is exacerbated by instability in the patient&#8217;s marital life. diagnosis:axis i:  dysthymia.  major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.axis ii:  borderline personality disorder.axis iii:  hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.axis iv:  medical access.  marital discord.axis v:  a gaf of 30. plan:  the patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder.  we will recommend the patient&#8217;s thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic.  we would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient&#8217;s reaction to her therapist&#8217;s departure.  we would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  we would recommend continued treatment with ssris for dysthymia and depression.  we would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as prozac, given the patient&#8217;s ambivalence regarding medications.  prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  we might also supplement the prozac with a (anti-sleep medication). time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.",320

"problem:  prescription evaluation for crohn&#8217;s disease. history:  this is a 46-year-old male who is here for a refill of imuran.  he is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  he is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  in fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. an x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  he thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  he has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  the patient&#8217;s normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  he has not had any rectal bleeding. he asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with iv insertion.  he has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  the tenderness has now completely resolved.   he had a colonoscopy performed in august of 2003, by dr. s.  an anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  dr. s recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  no active crohn&#8217;s disease was found during the colonoscopy.   earlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  at that time he was taking a lot of tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  under dr. s&#8217;s recommendation, he stopped the imuran for one month and reduced his dose of tylenol.  since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the imuran with no problems.   he also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  it used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  he takes over-the-counter h2 blockers as needed, as well as tums.  he

 data reviewed: labs from june 8th and july 19th reviewed.  liver function tests normal with ast 14 and alt 44.  wbcs were slightly low at 4.8.  hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  these results were reviewed by dr. s and lab results letter sent. impression:  1. crohn&#8217;s disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on imuran.  intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  last episode three weeks ago.2.  history of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of tylenol.  now resolved. 2.  increased frequency of reflux symptoms.3.  superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. 4.  slightly low h&#038;h. plan:  1.  we discussed dr. s&#8217;s recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  the patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  the patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  he states understanding of this. advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. 2.  continue with liver panel and abc every month per dr. s&#8217;s instructions.3.  continue imuran 100 mg per day.4.  continue to minimize tylenol use.  the patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  dr. s is consulted and agrees that imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. the patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. 5.  reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter h2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  the patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  he does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.6.    his thrombophlebitis appears to be resolving and does not have any alarming features present.  no treatment is needed at this time. he is instructed to call our office or his pcp if he experiences any pain, red streaking or fever. 7.  we will watch his cbc carefully to ensure that the h&#038;h does not continue to drop.  if it does, then he may need further evaluation with iron studies, b12 levels, or a gi evaluation.   followup:  continue liver panel and abc every month; follow up pending these results.  call our office for obstructive symptoms or continued reflux.  otherwise prescription evaluation in one year.",339
"cc: dysarthria hx: this 52y/o rhf was transferred from a local hospital to uihc on 10/28/94 with a history of progressive worsening of vision, dysarthria, headache, and incoordination beginning since 2/94. her husband recalled her first difficulties became noticeable after a motor vehicle accident in 2/94. she was a belted passenger in a car struck at a stop. there was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. she was treated and released from a local er the same day. her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. in 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in june. in 8/94, her ha changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. she also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. in 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. she had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. on 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself. evaluation at a local hospital revealed: 1)normal electronystagmography, 2)two lumbar punctures which revealed some atypical mononuclear cells suggestive of &quot;tumor or reactive lymphocytosis.&quot; one of these csf analysis showed: glucose 16, protein 99, wbc 14, rbc 114. echocardiogram was normal. bone marrow biopsy was normal except for decreased iron. abdominal-pelvic ct scan, cxr, mammogram, ppd, ana, tft, and rpr were unremarkable. a 10/31/94 mri brain scan a 5x10mm area of increased signal on t2 weighted images in the right remporal lobe lateral to the anterior aspect of the temporal horn, right posterolateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and bilateral inferior surface of the cerebellum involving gray and white matter. these areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast on t1 weighted images. meds: none. pmh: 1)g3p3, 2)last menses one year ago. fhx: mother suffered stroke in her 70&#8242;s. dm and htn in family. shx: married, secretary, no h/o tobacco/etoh/illicit drug use. ros: no weight loss, fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, dysphagia. exam: bp139/74, hr 90, rr20, 36.8c ms: drowsy to somnolent, occasionally &quot;giddy.&quot; oriented to person, place, time. minimal dysarthric speech, but appropriate. mmse 27/30 (copy of exam not in chart). cn: pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. optic disks were flat and without sign of papilledema. vfftc. eom intact. no nystagmus. the rest of the cn exam was unremarkable. motor: 5/5 strength throughout. normal muscle tone and bulk. sensory: no deficit to lt/pp/vib/prop. coord: difficulty with ram in bue, and ataxia on fnf and hks in all extremities. station: romberg sign present. gait: unsteady, wide-based, with notable difficulty on tw, tt and hw. reflexes: 2/2 bue, 0/1 patellae, trace at both archilles, plantars responses were flexor, bilaterally. gen exam: unremarkable. course: csf analysis by lumbar puncture, 10/31/94: protein 131mg/dl (normal 15-45), albumin 68 (normal 14-20), igg10mg/dl (normal &lt;6.2), igg index -o.1mg/24hr (normal), no oligoclonal bands seen, wbc 33 (19lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), rbc 29, glucose 13, cultures (bacteria, fungal, afb) were negative, crytococcal ag negative. the elevated csf total protein, igg, and albumin suggested breakdown of the blood brain barrier or blockage of csf flow. the normal igg synthesis rate and lack of oligoclonal banding did not suggest demylination. a second csf analysis on 11/2/94 revealed similar findings; and in addition anti-purkinje cell and anti-neuronal antibodies (yo and ho) were not found; beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis ag negative. serum ace, spep, urine histoplasmin were negative. neuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the mmpi (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted. chest-abdominal-pelvic ct scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the rmca, laca and left aica distributions. it was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of iv steroids. temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable. she underwent multiple mri brain scans at uihc: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. all scans consistently showed increase in t2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. these areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. these findings were felt most suggestive of glioma. she underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: this study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. bacterial, fungal , hsv, cmv and afb cultures were negative. hsv, and vzv antigen was negative. her neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. by time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required ngt feeding and 24hour supportive care. she was made dnr after family request prior to transfer to a care facility.",340

"history:  the patient was in the intensive care unit setting; he was intubated and sedated.  the patient is a 55-year-old patient, who was admitted secondary to a diagnosis of pancreatitis, developed hypotension and possible sepsis and respiratory as well as renal failure and found to be intubated.  he has been significantly hypotensive during his stay in the intensive care unit and has had minimal urine output.  his creatinine has gone from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight and the patient also developed florid acidosis and hypokalemia.  nephrology input has been requested for management of acute renal failure and acidosis. past medical history:1.  pancreatitis.2.  poison ivy.  the patient has recently been on oral steroids.3.  hypertension. medications:  include ambien, prednisone, and blood pressure medication, which is not documented in the record at the moment. inpatient medications:  include protonix iv, half-normal saline at 125 ml an hour, d5w with 3 ounces of bicarbonate at 150 ml an hour.  the patient was initially on dopamine, which has now been discontinued.  the patient remains on levophed and invanz 1 g iv q.24 h. physical examination:  vitals, emergency room presentation, the blood pressure was 82/45.  his blood pressure in the icu had dipped down into the 60s systolic, most recent blood pressure is 108/67 and he has been maintained on 100% fio2.  the patient has had minimal urine output since admission.  heent, the patient is intubated at the moment.  neck examination, no overt lymph node enlargement.  no jugular venous distention.  lungs examination is benign in terms of crackles.  the patient has some harsh breath sounds secondary to being intubated.  cvs, s1 and s2 are fairly regular at the moment.  there is no pericardial rub.  abdominal examination, obese, but benign.  extremity examination reveals no lower extremity edema.  cns, the patient is intubated and sedated. laboratory data:  blood work, sodium 152, potassium 2.7, bicarbonate 13, bun 36, and creatinine 4.2.  the patient&#8217;s bun and creatinine yesterday were 23 and 2.1 respectively.  h&#038;h of 17.7 and 51.6, white cell count of 8.4 from earlier on this morning.  the patient&#8217;s liver function tests are all out of whack and his alkaline phosphatase is 226, alt is 539, ck 1103, inr 1.66, and ammonia level of 55.  latest abgs show a ph of 7.04, bicarbonate of 10.7, pco2 of 40.3, and po2 of 120.7. assessment:1.  acute renal failure, which in all probability is secondary to acute tubular necrosis and sepsis and significant hypotension, but the patient is at the moment on 100% fio2.  he has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  the patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, i would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.2.  hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  now the patient has been maintained on levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.3.  acidosis, which is again secondary to his renal failure.  the patient was administered intravenous bicarbonate as mentioned above.  dialytic support in the form of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was highly recommended for possible correction of his electrolyte derangements.4.  pancreatitis, which has been managed by his gastroenterologist.5.  sepsis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.6.  hypercalcemia.  the patient has been given calcium chloride.  we will need to watch for rebound hypercalcemia.7.  hypoalbuminemia.8.  hypokalemia, which has been repleted. recommendations:  again include continuation of iv fluid and bicarbonate infusion as well as transfer to the piedmont hospital for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.",349
"chart note:  she is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  dr. xyz had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  then she had the pulmonary function test and ct scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see dr. xyz estep.  he had concurred with dr. xyz that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both dr. xyz and i were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  she was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  she is very concerned about the findings on her cat scan and pulmonary function test.  she seemed alarmed to report that dr. xyz had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  however, i told her that two years ago dr. xyz did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  and that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  after discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  in fact when i called dr. xyz to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  i also explained to patient that i did not think dr. xyz was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  and also i spoke with dr. xyz who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities. i had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  i also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her cat scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  and if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  but she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  she understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful. we are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  we will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  i told her i would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.",350

"preoperative diagnosis:  post infarct angina. type of procedure:  left cardiac catheterization with selective right and left coronary angiography. procedure:  after informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and the groin was prepped in the usual fashion.  using 1% lidocaine, the right groin was infiltrated, and using the seldinger technique, the right femoral artery was cannulated.  through this, a moveable guidewire was then advance to the level of the diaphragm, and through it, a 6 french pigtail catheter was advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the ascending aorta and inserted into the left ventricle.  pressure measurements were obtained and cineangiograms in the rao and lao positions were then obtained.  catheter was then withdrawn and a #6 french non-bleed-back sidearm sheath was then introduced, and through this, a 6 french judkins left coronary catheter was then advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the left coronary ostium, engaged.  cineangiograms were obtained of the left coronary system.  this catheter was then exchanged for a judkins right 4 coronary catheter of similar dimension and under hemodynamic monitoring again was advanced to the right coronary ostium, engaged.  cineangiograms were obtained, and the catheter and sheath were then withdrawn.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and left the cardiac catheterization laboratory in stable condition.  no evidence of hematoma formation or active bleeding.   complications:  none.   total contrast:  110 cc of hexabrix.   total fluoroscopy time:  1.8 minutes.   medications:  reglan 10 mg p.o., 5 mg p.o.  valium, benadryl 50 mg p.o. and heparin 3,000 units iv push.",356
"operation1.  ivor-lewis esophagogastrectomy.2.  feeding jejunostomy.3.  placement of two right-sided #28-french chest tubes.4.  right thoracotomy. anesthesia:  general endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube. operative procedure in detail:  after obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  in addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  after applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery.  the abdomen was opened.  next, a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  in an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  next, we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.  this was done and the stomach was freed up.  we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  at this point the stomach was freely mobile.  we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  a 2-0 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz.  we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  we placed a 16-french red rubber catheter through this site.  we tied down in place.  we then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a witzel.  next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  this was done with #1 prolene.  we put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 vicryl.  the skin was closed with 4-0 monocryl. next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  we then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery.  next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  the lung was deflated.  we placed standard chest retractors.  next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  the azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  as mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  after doing this, we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  we used an automatic pursestring and applied.  we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors.  we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 gia stapler.  after doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.  we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  we connected our anvil to the eea stapler.  this was then secured appropriately.  we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  we then fired the stapler.  we obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  this was closed with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  we then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 vicryl interrupted sutures.  we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  next, we placed two #28-french chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  we then closed the chest with #2 vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  the lung was brought up.  we closed the muscle layers with #0 vicryl followed by #0 vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 vicryl and the skin with 4-0 monocryl.  sterile dressing was applied.  the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.",357

"reason for referral:  the patient is a 76-year-old caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  he was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. relevant background information:  historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  a summary of pertinent information is presented below.  please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. history of presenting problem:  the patient was brought to the hospital emergency department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  he has no recollection of the event.  the following information is obtained from his medical record.  on 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times &quot;i do not feel well&quot; and looked &quot;glazed.&quot;  he does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  she thought he was warm and had chills.  he later returned to his baseline.  he was seen by dr. x in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  his neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the mini-mental status examination.  due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  the patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  he was hospitalized at hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative eeg, mri showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  he was also reportedly amnestic for this episode. in 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an mri at that time which showed some small vessel changes. during this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  he thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  when i asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he &quot;felt fine the whole time.&quot;  he appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  so, the patient reported some age related &quot;memory lapses&quot; such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  however, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  he denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  he does not have to recheck information for errors.  he is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  he reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  he said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  he reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  he did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  he remains completely independent in his adls.  he denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  he is also able to handle their finances.  he did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment. past medical history:  includes coronary artery disease, status post cabg in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by dr. y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  note that due to back pain, he had been taking percocet daily prior to his hospitalization. current medications:  celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine. other medical history:  surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  the patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  he quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  he denied any illicit drug use.  please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  he also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  upon discharge from the hospital, the patient&#8217;s sleep deprived eeg was recommended. mri completed on 09/30/09 showed &quot;mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated june 15, 2007.  no evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  ct scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  eeg was negative.  deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid. family medical history: reportedly significant for tias in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  in addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  he has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well. social history:  the patient obtained a law degree from the university of baltimore.  he did not complete his undergraduate degree from the university of maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  he reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the bar.  he thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  he reported that he repeated math classes &quot;every year of school&quot; and attended summer school every year due to that.  he has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  he served also in the u.s.  coast guard between 1951 and 1953.  he has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, linda, who is a homemaker.  they have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  he described being very active.  he goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends. psychiatric history:  the patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  he reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient. tasks administered:clinical interviewadult history questionnairewechsler test of adult reading (wtar)mini mental status exam (mmse)cognistat neurobehavioral cognitive status examinationrepeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (rbans;

based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the superior range.  he was notably impulse throughout the evaluation, as he would often try to begin a task before the examiner had completed providing instructions. cognitive functioning:  the patient was performed within the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning assessing his performance across several domains including attention, visuospatial construction, memory conceptualization and initiation or perseveration.  he performed within normal limits on all these domains. attention:  passive and active auditory attention fell in the average range as he was able to accurately repeat six digits in forward sequence and five digits in backward sequence.  visual working memory was in the high average range.  on a test of sustained attention for visual stimuli, he demonstrated high rate of accuracy despite the fact that there was mild decreases in consistency of his responses as the task progressed and at different interstimulus intervals.  overall, however, these results appear to be well within normal limits.  thus taken together the patient&#8217;s auditory and nonverbal attentional abilities, all fell within normal limits and did not suggest significant decline from premorbid levels. language:  confrontation naming was strong and in the high average range.  he demonstrated good comprehension for verbal instructions.  he made a few very mild errors on a sentence repetition task, which may have been due to mild hearing problems.  the errors did not appear to be of clinical significance.  rapid verbal retrieval fell in the average range for both phonemic and semantic cues well within broad normal limits.  this result may have represented a mild weakness relative to his estimated premorbid functioning.  thus taken together, language abilities generally fell within the expected range, although mild weaknesses were seen in verbal fluency. visuospatial perception and construction:  visuospatial perception appeared to be within broad normal limits, although his construction and copy of visual figures was quite sloppy and imprecise. learning &#038; memory skills: verbal learning and memory:  on a contextual memory task (i.e. stories), the patient performed within the average range immediately following story presentation, as well as following a delay.  his recognition of story details was in the low average range.  when given a large amount of seemingly unorganized information (i.e.  16-item list), the patient&#8217;s initial ability to recall five-items immediately following presentation was in the average range.  he benefited significantly from repetition as he was able to recall 10 items following the second presentation and following a fifth presentation, he was able to successfully recall 13 of the 16 items (superior).  when immediately provided with a second list of 16-items, he was only able to recall three items immediately following presentation (low average).  his recall of the first list following short and long delays was in the average range.  delayed recognition was also average. of note, during his recalls, he made a large number of repetition errors suggesting some difficulty with self-monitoring of his responses.  he also did not recognize and apply any organizational strategy.  taken together, the patient&#8217;s performance across measures of verbal learning and memory fell within broad normal limits relative to others of same age.  however, given his very high level of premorbid functioning, his performance suggested some mild weaknesses in encoding and retrieval that he is generally able to overcome with repetition of information. he also appeared to have some difficulty organizing and monitoring his responses and difficulty with learning multiple simultaneous streams of information. non-verbal learning and memory:  the patient&#8217;s immediate recall of visual designs was in the borderline range.  however, he retained most of the information that he initially learned following a delay and his performance fell in the low average range.  recognition was average.  taken together, these results again suggest that he had difficulties with encoding and retrieval of nonverbal information.  however, he was able to retain most of the reduced amount of information that he had initially learned. executive functioning:  as mentioned, initiation and verbal fluency fell in the average range.  it is mildly weaker than expected given the patient&#8217;s strong premorbid functioning.  he was also noted to make a number of repetition errors on this task.  cognitive set shifting was generally within expected limits and in the average to high average range.  he was able to successfully inhibit a prepotent response.  on a task assessing cognitive flexibility inductive reasoning and the ability to use feedback in order to correct an ongoing response, the patient was noted to be quite impulsive and had difficulty conceptualizing alternate means to apply strategies in order to determine the correct answer and appeared to be somewhat distracted by nonessential information.  as mentioned above, he had a number of repetitions and difficulty organizing information meaningfully on memory tasks.  taken together, these results suggest mild weaknesses in aspects of frontal lobe functioning. motor functioning:  the patient performed in the average range with both of his right dominant hand and left nondominant hand on a speeded fine motor coordination task. emotional functioning:  on an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only four items, which suggested that he was bothered by thoughts he could not get out of his head, often felt helpless, felt downhearted and blue and that his mind was not as clear as it used to be.  overall, these results fell within normal limits and suggest that he is not currently experiencing a clinical level of depressive symptoms. summary &#038; impressions:  the patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation due to possible changes in memory.  he has a history of two episodes of confusion and amnesia, the most recent of which occurred in september 2009 with differential diagnosis including seizure disorder versus transient global amnesia.  on this comprehensive evaluation, the patient demonstrated mild weaknesses relative to his very high level of premorbid functioning on tasks assessing memory and executive functioning.",360
"subjective:  the patient states that she feels better.  she is on iv amiodarone, the dosage pattern is appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  researching the available records, i find only an ems verbal statement that tachycardia of wide complex was seen.  there is no strip for me to review all available ekg tracings show a narrow complex atrial fibrillation pattern that is now converted to sinus rhythm. the patient states that for a week, she has been home postoperative from aortic valve replacement on 12/01/08 at abc medical center.  the aortic stenosis was secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve, by her description.  she states that her shortness of breath with exertion has been stable, but has yet to improve from its preoperative condition.  she has not had any decline in her postoperative period of her tolerance to exertion. the patient had noted intermittent bursts of fast heart rate at home that had been increasing over the last several days.  last night, she had a prolonged episode for which she contacted ems.  her medications at home had been uninterrupted and without change from those listed, being toprol-xl 100 mg q.a.m., dyazide 25/37.5 mg, nexium 40 mg, all taken once a day.  she has been maintaining her crestor and zetia at 20 and 10 mg respectively.  she states that she has been taking her aspirin at 325 mg q.a.m.  she remains on zyrtec 10 mg q.a.m.  her only allergy is listed to latex. objective:vital signs:  temperature 36.1, heart rate 60, respirations 14, room air saturation 98%, and blood pressure 108/60.  the patient shows a normal sinus rhythm on the telemetry monitor with an occasional pac.general:  she is alert and in no apparent distress.heent:  eyes:  eomi.  perrla.  sclerae nonicteric.  no lesions of lids, lashes, brows, or conjunctivae noted.  funduscopic examination unremarkable.  ears:  normal set, shape, tms, canals and hearing.  nose and sinuses:  negative.  mouth, tongue, teeth, and throat:  negative except for dental work.neck:  supple and pain free without bruit, jvd, adenopathy or thyroid abnormality.chest:  lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.  the incision is well healed and without evidence of significant cellulitis.heart:  shows a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, heave, click, thrill or rub.  there is an occasional extra beat noted, which corresponds to a premature atrial contraction on the monitor.abdomen:  soft and benign without hepatosplenomegaly, rebound, rigidity or guarding.extremities:  show no evidence of dvt, acute arthritis, cellulitis or pedal edema.neurologic:  nonfocal without lateralizing findings for cranial or peripheral nervous systems, strength, sensation, and cerebellar function.  gait and station were not tested.mental status:  shows the patient to be alert, coherent with full capacity for decision making.back:  negative to inspection or percussion. laboratory data:  shows from 12/15/08 2100, hemoglobin 11.6, white count 12.9, and platelets 126,000.  inr 1.0.  electrolytes are normal with exception potassium 3.3.  gfr is decreased at 50 with creatinine of 1.1.  glucose was 119.  magnesium was 2.3.  phosphorus 3.8.  calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  the patient has had ionized calcium checked at munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  this morning, her bnp was 163 at admission.  her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  her current ekg tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with wolff-parkinson white pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected qt interval of 557 milliseconds.  her pr interval was 0.12. we received a call from munson medical center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  i contacted dr. varner and we reviewed the patient&#8217;s managed to this point.  all combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  this is based on her ep study from october showing her to be non-inducible.  in addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  what is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  her wpw may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  at this point, we will convert the patient from iv amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  i will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.  dr. varner will be making arrangements for an outpatient holter monitor and further followup post-discharge. impression:1.  atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.2.  wolff-parkinson white syndrome.3.  recent aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic medtronic valve.4.  hyperlipidemia.",361
"history of present illness:  mr. a is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged.  he, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on coumadin. the patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead ekg here.  otherwise, no chest pain. past medical history:  significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide.  he completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia.  other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia. medications:as outpatient,1.  atenolol 25 mg once a day.2.  altace 2.5 mg once a day.3.  zocor 20 mg once a day.4.  flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.5.  coumadin as directed by our office. allergies:  to medications are none.  he denies shrimp, sea food or dye allergy. family history:  he has a nephew who was his sister&#8217;s son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an mi, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  the patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, dr. x, at general hospital and it sounds like he had a negative ep study. social history:  the patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  no use of illicit drugs.  he has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today&#8217;s cardiology consultation by his wife.  he is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  he is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college. review of systems:  he denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  there are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study. physical exam:  blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  on general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  heent:  shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  he has moist mucosal membranes.  neck veins are not distended.  there are no carotid bruits.  visible skin warm and perfused.  affect appropriate.  he is quite oriented and pleasant.  no significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.  lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  no wheezes.  no egophony.  cardiac exam:  s1, s2.  regular rate, controlled.  no significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  pmi is nondisplaced.  abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  extremities without significant edema.  pulses grossly intact. diagnostic studies/lab data:  initial ecg shows atrial flutter. impression:  mr. a is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  i have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was i primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as i did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of cva, although we cannot really make that null.  the patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  i invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure. procedure note:  the patient received a total of 7 mg of versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  the patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  after the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using &quot;lollipop posterior patch&quot; with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead ekg. impression:  cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3.22.  we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  i had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, dr. x, at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr. x myself.  again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms. i had previously discussed the case with dr. y who is the patient&#8217;s general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient&#8217;s

"history of present illness:  hospitalist followup is required for continuing issues with atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which was resistant to treatment with diltiazem and amiodarone, being followed by dr. x of cardiology through most of the day.  this afternoon, when i am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a map of 52.  dr. x was again consulted from the bedside.  we agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider neo-synephrine pressure support if this is not successful.  in addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient&#8217;s possible move to tahoe pacific or a long-term acute care.  other issues requiring following up today are elevated transaminases, continuing fever, pneumonia, resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, hypokalemia, non-st-elevation mi, hypernatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bph, atrial flutter, inferior vena cava filter, and diabetes. physical examinationvital signs:  t-max 103.2, blood pressure at this point is running in the 70s/mid 40s with a map of 52, heart rate is 100.general:  the patient is much more alert appearing than my last examination of approximately 3 weeks ago.  he denies any pain, appears to have intact mentation, and is in no apparent distress.eyes:  pupils round, reactive to light, anicteric with external ocular motions intact.cardiovascular:  reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm.lungs:  have diminished breath sounds but are clear anteriorly.abdomen:  somewhat distended but with no guarding, rebound, or obvious tenderness to palpation.extremities:  show trace edema with no clubbing or cyanosis.neurological:  the patient is moving all extremities without focal neurological deficits. laboratory data:  sodium 149; this is down from 151 yesterday.  potassium 3.9, chloride 114, bicarb 25, bun 35, creatinine 1.5 up from 1.2 yesterday, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 36.3, wbc 16.5, platelets 231,000.  inr 1.4.  transaminases are continuing to trend upwards of sgot 546, sgpt 256.  also noted is a scant amount of very concentrated appearing urine in the bag. impression:  overall impressions continues to be critically ill 67-year-old with multiple medical problems probably still showing signs of volume depletion with hypotension and atrial flutter with difficult to control rate. plan1.  hypotension.  i would aggressively try and fluid replete the patient giving him another liter of fluids.  if this does not work as discussed with dr. x, we will start some neo-synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion as i do think that indications are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluids will still be required even if pressure support is started.2.  increased transaminases.  presumably this is from increased congestion.  this is certainly concerning.  we will continue to follow this.  ultrasound of the liver was apparently negative.3.  fever and elevated white count.  the patient does have a history of pneumonia and empyema.  we will continue current antibiotics per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient&#8217;s white count.  he is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time.  indeed, he does look improved from my last examination.4.  ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure.  the patient has received a tracheostomy since my last examination.  vent management per pma.5.  hypokalemia.  this has resolved.  continue supplementation.6.  hypernatremia.  this is improving somewhat.  i am hoping that with increased fluids this will continue to do so.7.  diabetes mellitus.  fingerstick blood glucoses are reviewed and are at target.  we will continue current management.  this is a critically ill patient with multiorgan dysfunction and signs of worsening renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular function with extremely guarded prognosis.  total critical care time spent today 37 minutes.",363
"reason for visit:  acute kidney failure. history of present illness:  the patient is a 68-year-old korean gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and stage iii ckd with a creatinine of 1.8 in may 2006 corresponding with the gfr of 40-41 ml/min.  the patient had blood work done at dr. xyz&#8217;s office on june 01, 2006, which revealed an elevation in his creatinine up to 2.3.  he was asked to come in to see a nephrologist for further evaluation.  i am therefore asked by dr. xyz to see this patient in consultation for evaluation of acute on chronic kidney failure.  the patient states that he was actually taking up to 12 to 13 pills of chinese herbs and dietary supplements for the past year.  he only stopped about two or three weeks ago.  he also states that tricor was added about one or two months ago but he is not sure of the date.  he has not had an ultrasound but has been diagnosed with prostatic hypertrophy by his primary care doctor and placed on flomax.  he states that his urinary dribbling and weak stream had not improved since doing this.  for the past couple of weeks, he has had dizziness in the morning.  this is then associated with low glucose.  however the patient&#8217;s blood glucose this morning was 123 and he still was dizzy.  this was worse on standing.  he states that he has been checking his blood pressure regularly at home because he has felt so bad and that he has gotten under 100/60 on several occasions.  his pulses remained in the 60s. allergies:  none. medications:  imdur 20 mg two to three times daily, nitroglycerin p.r.n., insulin 70/30 40/45 units daily, zetia 10 mg daily, ? triglide 50 mg daily, prevacid 30 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily, potassium 10 meq daily, lasix 60 mg daily, folate 1 mg b.i.d., niaspan 500 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg daily, enalapril 10 mg b.i.d., glyburide 10 mg b.i.d., xanax 0.25 mg b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg daily, tylenol p.r.n., zantac 150 mg b.i.d., crestor 5 mg daily, tricor 145 mg daily, digitek 0.125 mg daily, celexa 20 mg daily, and flomax 0.4 mg daily. past medical history:1.  coronary artery disease status post cabg x 5 in december 2001.2.  three stents last placed approximately 2002.3.  heart failure, ejection fraction of 30%.4.  hypertension since 1985.5.  diabetes since 1985 with history of laser surgery.6.  moderate mitral regurgitation.7.  gi bleed.8.  hyperlipidemia.9.  bph.10.  back surgery.11.  sleep apnea. social history:  he is a former tailor from korea.  he is divorced.  he has one daughter who has brain injury status post severe seizure as a child.  he is the primary caregiver.  no drug abuse.  he quit tobacco and alcohol 15 years ago. family history:  parents both died in korea.  has one sister with hypertension and the other sister lives in detroit and is healthy. review of systems:  he has lost about 10 pounds over the past month.  he has been fatigue and weak with no appetite.  he has occasional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion on fast walking.  his lower extremity edema has improved with higher doses of furosemide.  he does complain of some early satiety.  he complains of urinary frequency, nocturia, weak stream and dribbling.  he has never passed the stone.  he gets dizzy when his blood sugars are in the 40s to 60s but now this is continuing with him running, glucose is in the 120s.  he has some right back pain today and complains of farsightedness.  the remainder of review of systems is done and negative per the patient. physical examination:  vital signs:  pulse 78.  blood pressure 116/60.  height 5&#8217;7&quot;

"reason for referral:  cardiac evaluation and treatment in a patient who came in the hospital with abdominal pain. history:  this is a 77-year-old white female patient whom i have known for the last about a year or so who has underlying multiple medical problems including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post aortocoronary bypass surgery about eight years ago at halifax medical center where she had triple vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.  since then, she has generally done well.  she used to be seeing another cardiologist and apparently she had a stress test in september 2008 and she was otherwise cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, but the patient declined to have one done and since then she has been on medical therapy. the patient had been on medical therapy at home and generally doing well.  recently, she had no leg swelling, undue exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  she denies any rest or exertional chest discomfort.  yesterday evening, she had her dinner and she was sitting around and she felt discomfort in the chest at about 7:00 p.m.  the discomfort was a crampy pain in the left lower quadrant area, which seemed to radiating to the center of the abdomen and to the right side and it was off and on lasting for a few minutes at a time and then subsiding.  later on she was nauseous, but she did not have any vomiting.  she denied any diarrhea.  no history of fever or chills.  since the pain seemed to persist, the patient came to the hospital emergency room at 11:35 p.m. where she was seen and admitted for the same.  she was given morphine, zofran, demerol, another zofran, and reglan as well as demerol again and she was given intravenous fluids.  subsequently, her pain finally went away and she does not have any pain since about 7:00 a.m. this morning.  the patient was admitted however for further workup and treatment.  at the time of my examination this afternoon, the patient is sitting, lying in bed and comfortable and has no abdominal pain of any kind.  she has not been fed any food, however.  the patient also had had pelvis and abdominal ct scan performed, which has been described to be partial small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, volvulus or adhesion most likely in the left flank area.  the patient has had left nephrectomy and splenectomy, which has been described.  a 1.5-mm solid mass is described to be in the lower pole of the kidney.  the patient also has been described to have diverticulosis without diverticulitis on this finding. currently however, the patient has no clinical symptoms according to her. past medical history:  she has had hypertension and hyperlipidemia for the last 15 years, diabetes mellitus for the last eight years, and coronary artery disease for last about eight years or so.  she had a chest and back pain about eight years ago for about two weeks and then subsequently she was reported to be evaluated.  she has a small myocardial infarction and then she was under the care of dr. a and she had aortocoronary bypass surgery at halifax medical center by dr. b, which was a three-vessel bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the left circumflex and distal right coronary artery respectively. she had had nuclear stress test with dr. c on september 3, 2008, which was described to be abnormal with ischemic defects, but i do not think the patient had any further cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography after that.  she has been treated medically. this patient also had an admission to this hospital in may 2008 also for partial small bowel obstruction and cholelithiasis and sigmoid diverticulosis.  she was described to have had a hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney.  she has mild arthritis for the last 10 or 15 years.  she has a history of gerd for the last 20 years, and she also has a history of peptic ulcer disease in the duodenum, but never had any bleeding.  she has a history of diverticulosis as mentioned.  no history of tia or cva.  she has one kidney.  she was in a car accident in 1978 and afterwards she had to have left nephrectomy as well as splenectomy because of rupture.  the patient has a history of pulmonary embolism once about eight years ago after her aortocoronary bypass surgery.  she describes this to be a clot on left lung.  i am not sure if she had any long-term treatment, however. in the past, the patient had aortocoronary bypass surgery in 2003 and incisional hernia surgery in 1979 as well as hysterectomy in 1979 and she had splenectomy and nephrectomy as described in 1978. family history:  her father died at age of 65 of massive heart attack and mother died at age of 62 of cancer.  she had a one brother who died of massive heart attack in his 50s, a brother died at the age of 47 of cancer, and another brother died in his 60s of possible rupture of appendix. social history:  the patient is a widow.  she lives alone.  she does have three daughters, two of them live in georgia and one lives in tennessee.  she did smoke in the past up to one to one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for about 10 years, but she quit long time ago.  she never drank any alcohol.  she likes to drink one or two cups of tea in a day. allergies:  paxil. medications:  her home medications prior to coming in include some of the following medications, although the exact list is not available in the chart at this stage, but they have been on glyburide, januvia, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, simvastatin, ranitidine, meloxicam, and furosemide. review of systems:  appetite is good.  she sleeps good at night.  she has no headaches and she has mild joint pains from arthritis. physical examination:vital signs:  pulse

enlargement, and right bundle branch block.  this is overall unchanged compared to previous electrocardiogram, which also has the same present.  nuclear stress test from 2008 was described to show ejection fraction of 49% and inferior and posterolateral ischemia.  otherwise, laboratory data includes on this patient at this stage wbc 18.3, hemoglobin 15.5, hematocrit is 47.1, and platelet count is 326,000.  electrolytes, sodium 137, potassium 5.2, chloride 101, co2 27, bun 34, creatinine 1.2, calcium 9.5, and magnesium 1.7.  ast and alt are normal.  albumin is 4.1.  lipase and amylase are

"single chamber pacemaker implantation preoperative diagnosis:  mobitz type ii block with av dissociation and syncope. postoperative diagnosis:  mobitz type ii block, status post single chamber pacemaker implantation, boston scientific altrua 60, serial number 123456. procedures:1.  left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.2.  left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.3.  insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is boston scientific dextrose model 4136, serial number 123456.4.  insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, altrua, serial number 123456.5.  closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker. procedure in detail:  the procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  the patient agreed and signed the consent form.  the patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of benadryl for conscious sedation. access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  the first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  the needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  the j-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein. the anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used. the pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the bovie cautery for hemostasis.  the patient went asystole during the procedure.  the transcutaneous pacer was used.  the patient was oxygenating well.  the patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  however, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby. after that, the j-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-french sheath into the left subclavian vein.  the lead from the boston scientific dextrose model 4136, serial number 28520361 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 ml of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  the findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  at that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place. at that point, the lead was actively fixated.  the stylet was removed.  the r-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  the impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  the numbers were accepted and because of the patient&#8217;s fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  i decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system. after that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two ethibond sutures in the usual fashion. the lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  the pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker altura 60, serial number 123456.  after that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 vicryl continuous. the pacemaker was programmed as vvi 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  the lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray. no significant bleeding noticed. conclusion:  successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.  no significant bleed.",377
"i had the pleasure of seeing mr. abc in neurologic consultation and follow-up on mm/dd/yyyy.  mr. abc reports that he has had several issues in the family.  one of them is that his grandmother passed.  in addition, the family dog fell ill.  this has led to distress.  he reports better controlled pain.  mr. abc reports, otherwise, intermittent adherence to copaxone.  he had in the past been on interferon, but did not tolerate the medication, because of side effects.  his sleep/wake cycle remains very erratic. social history, family history, and past medical history: reviewed.  there are no changes, otherwise. review of systems:  fatigue, pain, difficulty with sleep, mood fluctuations, low stamina, mild urgency frequency and hesitancy, preponderance of lack of stamina, preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder. examination:  the patient is alert and oriented.  extraocular movements are full.  the face is symmetric.  the uvula is midline.  speech has normal prosody.  today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder.  in the lower extremities, iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris and tibialis anterior are full.  the gait is narrow based and noncircumductive.  rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally.  the gait does not have significant slapping characteristics.  sensory examination is largely unremarkable.  heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits. impression:  mr. abc is doing about the same.  we discussed the issue of adherence to copaxone.  in order to facilitate this, i would like him to take copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm.  his wife continues to inject him.  he has not been able to start himself on the injections. greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling.",378

"referral questions:  mr. abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a depression, or a bipolar spectrum disorder.  the information will be used for treatment planning. background information:  mr. abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  he has been married since 1995 and lost a son to sids over seven years ago.  he served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at uaa.  he still wants to get a degree in engineering.  mr. abcd indicated that he did use thc at the time of his initial intake with me in january 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as i am aware.  he has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife&#8217;s significant health problems.  he also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  he has received counseling in the past, and did try both lexapro and wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in october 2005.  he indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  he indicated that he thought he might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  there is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  a recent stressor involved ocs involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for thc.  so far as i am aware, this case is closed at this time.   behavioral observations:  mr. abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  he was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  the results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed. assessment results:  mr. abcd&#8217;s responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by dr. starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  i therefore had him complete the conners cpt-ii, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  the confidence index associated with adhd was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  while a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the cpt-ii measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  the mmpi-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  the modified welsh code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  f&#8217;+-/:lk#.  the high f scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  the basic clinical profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  they also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  mr. abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  a bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though i am less confident that that is correct.  the mmpi-2 content scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the supplementary scales has a single clinical elevation on addiction admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the mmpi-2. summary and recommendations:   mr. abcd certainly has multiple stressors in his life, and i suspect that some of his reported attention and concentration difficulties are more related to those problems than to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  conners cpt-ii results do not provide support for that diagnosis, and in the absence of other data, i would tend to rule out adhd at this time.  the mmpi-2 profile indicates some problems with impulsivity, family stressors, and mild depressive symptoms.  posttraumatic stress disorder scales do not reach clinical significance.  the profile suggests some impulsivity, restlessness, moodiness, irritability, problems with frustration tolerance, poor decision making, and potential conflicts with authority.  a bipolar spectrum disorder diagnosis is a possibility and i would recommend exploring treatment options to further examine and address this.  an antisocial personality disorder may be present, or traits of antisocial personality may be present, but at this point, i do not see sufficient evidence to warrant that diagnosis.",382

"history of present illness: the patient is a 79-year-old right-handed man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago, he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom.  at that time, he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell.  he reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused, but was aware of what was happening around him.  he was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son, subsequently returned back to normal. he was then well until the 3rd of july 2008 when his legs again gave way on him.  this was not preceded by lightheadedness.  he was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia, and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia.  he started using a walker from that time, prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day.  he again had a fall in august of 2008 after his legs gave way.  again, there was no lightheadedness associated with this.  he was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this.  he did not, however, return to the pre-july baseline.  in october of 2008, after another fall, he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles.  he is currently in a chronic rehabilitation unit.  he cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything.  he states that his hands have been numb, involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks.  he is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands.  he does, however, note that strength in his hands has not been normal since july 2008, but it is clearly getting worse.  he has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in august 2008, these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs.  he does not report any cramps, problems with swallowing or problems with breathing.  he reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea, although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder.  he has had some problems with blood pressure drops, and does feel presyncopal when he stands.  he also reports that he has no feeling in his feet, and that his feet feel like sponges.  this has been present for about nine months.  he has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months. past medical history:1.  pneumonia.  he has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia, which started at approximately age 20.  these have been treated repeatedly over the years, and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years, although this has been far more frequent in the past year.  he is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.  there is no known history of bronchiectasis, inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia.2.  he has had a catheter placed for urinary retention, his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement.  the patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems.  he has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month.3.  he had an appendectomy in the 1940s.4.  he had an ankle resection in 1975. social history:  the patient stopped smoking 27 years ago, he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars.  he has not smoked for the past 27 years.  he hardly ever uses alcohol.  he is currently retired. family history:  there is no family history of neuropathy, pes cavus, foot deformities, or neuromuscular diseases.  his aunt has a history of type ii diabetes. current medications:  fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d., midodrine 5 mg p.o.

mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n., protonix 40 mg per day, and megace 400 mg per day. allergies:  he has no medication or food allergies. review of systems:  please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today. general physical examination:vital signs:  bp was 137/60, p was 89, and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair.  his pain score was 0.appearance:  no acute distress.  he is pleasant and well-groomed.heent:  atraumatic, normocephalic.  no carotid bruits appreciated.lungs:  there were few coarse crackles in both lung bases.cardiovascular:  revealed a normal first and second heart sound, with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs.  the pulse was regular and of normal volume.abdomen:  soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds.  there were no carotid bruits.extremities:  no contractures appreciated. neurological exam:mse:  his orientation, language, calculations, 100-7 tests were all normal.  there was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs.cranial nerves:  cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations.  his palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal.motor:  strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows:  deltoid 4/4, biceps 4+/4+, triceps 5/5, wrist extensors 4+/4+, finger extensors 4-/4-, finger flexors 4-/4-, interossei 4-/4-, hip flexors 4+/4+, hip extensors 4+/4+, knee extensors 4/4, and knee flexors 4/4.  foot dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1.  there was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.  the feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features.  fasciculations were present mainly in the hands.  there was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand.reflexes:  reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs.  the jaw reflex was 2+.  vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers.  vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee.  joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers.  pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs.  pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows.  the same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing.coordination:  coordination was barely normal in the right hand.  rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand.  the patient was unable to stand and therefore gait, romberg&#8217;s test and balance could not be assessed. diagnostic studies:  previous diagnostic studies and patient reports.  there were extensive patient reports, all of which were reviewed.  a previous x-ray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate.  an x-ray of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.  a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid, a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55% stenosis.  the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis.  there was no significant stenosis, but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted.  an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct, major vascular occlusion, and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration.  there was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis.  this was an essentially normal brain mri.  a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3, a low red cell count of 3.43, elevated mch of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal.  an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127, a calcium which was low at 8.3, and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1.  the glucose was 86.  tsh performed in january 2009 was 1.57, which is within the normal range.  vitamin b12 was greater than a 1000, which is normal and the folate was 18.2, which was normal.  a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect.  the ecg was non-diagnostic.  there was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle.  the left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, which is within the normal range for males.  a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broad-based disc bulge at l1-l2, l2-l3, l3-l4 and l4-l5.  at l5-s1, in addition to the broad-based disc bulge, there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis.  there was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5-s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1-l4.  an echocardiogram was performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular systolic function, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. diagnostic impression:  the patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings.  he is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities, although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities.  his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities, signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia.  according to the history, which was carefully checked, the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years, although there has only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008.  as indicated below, further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory, motor, and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy.  there was no involvement of the tongue on emg.  the laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy.  we are still, however, waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies, which were send out lab to the mayo clinic.  this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as sle, sjogren&#8217;s, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease.  in addition, it may also be seen with certain toxins, particularly chemotherapeutic agents.  the patient did not receive any of these.  it may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.  although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer, it is noted that he has had an 18-pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking.  we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest, abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation.  the verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer.  we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.  the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy, this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm.  this showed evidence of severe axonal loss.  there was no evidence of a vasculitis.  the vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis.  there were a few perivascular changes; however, there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections.  the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy, with evidence of fiber grouping.  again, there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis.  evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy, no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy, of sarcoidosis, and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy.  specifically, there is no history of hiv exposure.  we would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis.  at this point, because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy, there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness, unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed.  i have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son.  we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy.  i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder. there is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy, and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2.  however, since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago, i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this. plan:1.  nerve conduction and emg will be performed today.  the results were indicated above.2.  the following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes, cbc, thyroid function tests, b12, ana, c-reactive protein, complement, cryoglobulins, double-stranded dna antibodies, folate level, hemoglobin a1c, immunofixation electrophoresis, p-anca, c-anca, protein electrophoresis, rheumatoid factor, paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the mayo clinic, b12.  these studies showed minor changes, which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted, a low creatinine of 0.74, low calcium of 8.6, low total protein of 5.7.  the b12 was greater than 2000.  the immunoelectrophoresis, ana, double-stranded dna, anca, hemoglobin a1c, folate, cryoglobulins, complement, c-reactive protein were all normal or negative.  the b12 level was greater than 2000.  liver function tests were normal.  the glucose was 90.  esr was 10.  hemoglobin a1c was 5.5.3.  a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above.4.  ct of chest, abdomen and pelvis.5.  whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.6.  the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute rehabilitation and training.7.  we have not made any changes to his medication.  he does have some mild orthostatic changes; however, he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day.  usually, he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day.8.  followup will be as determined by the family.",387
"reason for visit:  the patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  he is accompanied by his wife and daughter. history of present illness:  i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20, 2007.  at that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  this included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted.  when i saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine.  i subsequently referred him to dr. x, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16, 2008.  according to his notes this went well. according to the family, there has not been any improvement. with regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago.  he is virtually unable to walk at all.  he needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  therefore, he is always in the wheelchair. he is completely incontinent.  he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  on the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go.  he wears a depends undergarment all the time. he has no headaches. his thinking and memory are worse.  for the most part, he is apathetic.  he does not talk very much.  he lives in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimer&#8217;s section.  he does have some daytime activities.  he takes a nap once a day.  he does not read very much.  on the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  he needs full assistance at the nursing home. medications:  from the list by the nursing home are aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (celexa) 40 mg daily, colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (proscar) 5 mg once a day, flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed. physical exam:  on examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  he is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. vital signs:  temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71. head:  the head is normocephalic and atraumatic. mental status:  assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  the mini-mental state exam score was 14/30.  he was not at all oriented.  he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor.  he could spell &#8216;world&#8217; forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards.  he was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall.  he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  for comparison, the mini-mental state exam score last december was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell &#8216;world&#8217; backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers.  i do not see any paraphasic errors.  there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  he is also stimulus bound.  there is a tendency to mimic. cranial nerve exam:  there is no upgaze that i can elicit today.  the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  this is a change from a year ago.  the muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement. motor exam:  normal bulk and strength.  the tone is characterized by paratonia.  there is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor. sensory exam:  intact to light touch. cerebellar exam:  intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands. gait:  severely impaired.  when in the wheelchair, he leans to one side.  he cannot getup on his own.  he needs assistance.  once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  this would amount to a tinetti score of zero. review of x-rays:  i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1, 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago.  the ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  the frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm.  the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  there is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  the scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct. assessment:  the patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles. problems/diagnoses:1.  question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).2.  possible supranuclear palsy.3.  severe gait impairment.4.  urinary urgency and incontinence.5.  dementia. plan:  i had a long talk with him and his family.  even though he has already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago, i offered this test to them again.  i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan.  his family and i discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  i specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection.",388

"preoperative diagnosis:  acute left subdural hematoma. postoperative diagnosis:  acute left subdural hematoma. procedure:  left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma. description of procedure:  this is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia.  he is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  he presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  his ct imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric. the patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  he had previously been intubated and taken to the intensive care unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  the images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition.  he was fixed in a three-point headrest.  his scalp was shaved and prepared with betadine, iodine and alcohol.  we made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  the scalp was reflected.  a single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  after completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  the brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  we investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.  after we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  we placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  the scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the ct scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the intensive care unit for further management. i was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  i confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain.",401
"title of procedure:  coronary artery bypass grafting times three utilizing the left internal mammary artery, left anterior descending and reversed autogenous saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery and obtuse marginal coronary artery, total cardiopulmonary bypass, cold blood potassium cardioplegia, antegrade and retrograde, for myocardial protection. description of procedure:  the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  appropriate monitoring devices were placed.  the chest, abdomen and legs were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  the right greater saphenous vein was harvested and prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 surgilon and flushed with heparinized blood.  hemostasis was achieved in the legs and closed with running 2-0 dexon in the subcutaneous tissue and running 3-0 dexon subcuticular in the skin.  median sternotomy incision was made and the left mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff of the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  the pericardium was opened.  the pericardial cradle was created.  the patient was fully heparinized and cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula and bypass was instituted.  a retrograde cardioplegic cannula was placed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 prolene suture in the right atrial wall into the coronary sinus and tied to a rumel tourniquet.  an antegrade cardioplegic needle sump combination was placed in the ascending aorta and tied in place with 4-0 prolene.  the ascending aorta was crossclamped.  cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given to the ascending aorta followed by sumping through the ascending aorta followed by cold retrograde potassium cardioplegia.  the obtuse marginal coronary artery was identified and opened and end-to-side anastomosis was performed to the reversed autogenous saphenous vein with running 7-0 prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  cold antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given and the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery was identified and opened.  end-to-side anastomosis was performed with a running 7-0 prolene suture and the vein was cut to length.  cold antegrade and retrograde potassium cardioplegia were given.  the mammary artery was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  the anterior descending was identified and opened.  end-to-side anastomosis was performed through the left internal mammary artery with running 8-0 prolene suture.  the mammary pedicle was sutured to the heart with interrupted 5-0 prolene suture.  a warm antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia were given.  the aortic crossclamp was removed.  the partial occlusion clamp was placed.  aortotomies were made.  the veins were cut to fit these and sutured in place with running 5-0 prolene suture.  a partial occlusion clamp was removed.  all anastomoses were inspected and noted to be patent and dry.  ventricular and atrial pacing wires were placed.  the patient was fully warmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  the patient was decannulated in the routine fashion and protamine was given.  good hemostasis was noted.  a single mediastinal and left pleural chest tube were placed.  the sternum was closed with interrupted wire, linea alba with running 0 prolene, the sternal fascia was closed with running 0 prolene, the subcutaneous tissue with running 2-0 dexon and the skin with running 3-0 dexon subcuticular stitch.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.",402
"reason for consultation:  neurologic consultation was requested by dr. x to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy. history of present illness:  the patient is well known to me.  she has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  she also has a history of factor v leiden deficiency.  she was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  at that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her trileptal dose if seizures continue.  she did well on 2 ml twice a day without any sedation.  this past friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  this consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  her trileptal dose was increased to 3 ml b.i.d. yesterday. according to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  she appeared to be stable until this past monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  according to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  she still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  when she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  she is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  she has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  she has been seizure free since her admission. laboratory data:  pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  crp is less than 0.3, cmp normal, and cbc within normal limits.  csf cultures so far is negative.  dr. limon&#8217;s note refers to a csf, white blood cell count of 2, 1 rbc, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  there are no imaging studies in the computer.  i believe that this may have been done at kaweah delta hospital and reviewed by dr. x, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection. current medications:  trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin. physical examination:general:  the patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  there was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  she eventually started crying and became agitated.  she made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.heent:  she was obviously visually impaired.  pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.extremities:  bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  there was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  iv was noted on the left hand. assessment:  seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded. i concur with dr. x&#8217;s recommendations.  i do not recommend any changes in trileptal for now.  i will be available while she remains hospitalized.",403

the patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment act for grave disability. history of present illness:  the patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  he reports being diagnosed with aids and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  prior to admission, the patient was brought to emergency room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  the patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour involuntary treatment act for grave disability. on the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  he believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary. i was able to contact his partner by telephone.  his partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  his partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  his partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  he also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  he also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  he also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that his partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  he reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  he states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  his partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  he reports of the patient&#8217;s longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient&#8217;s dislike of taking medicine.  he also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition. past psychiatric history:  the patient&#8217;s partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  the patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  he dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  his partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was &quot;useful, but not dosed high enough.&quot; past medication trials that the patient reports include haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful. medical history:  the patient reports being diagnosed with hiv and aids in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  he is currently followed at clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  the patient is fairly vague on his history of aids related conditions, but does identify the following:  thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections;

at family gathering. unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the &quot;assassin.&quot; prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. as the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. she and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. in prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a &quot;chuckle.&quot; while in colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing &quot;murder she wrote.&quot; she needed assistance to complete the game. the family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. she returned to work at a local florist shop the monday following thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. she quit working the next day and never went back. her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of november and december and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. serum vdrl, tfts, gs, b12, folate, cbc, cxr, and mri of the brain were all reportedly unremarkable. the working diagnosis was &quot;dementia of the alzheimer&#8217;s type.&quot;

"problem:  chronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function tests. history:  the patient is a 23-year-old female referred for evaluation due to a chronic history of abdominal pain and extensive work-up for abnormal liver function tests and this chronic nausea and vomiting referred here for further evaluation due to the patient&#8217;s recent move from eugene to portland.  the patient is not a great historian.  most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  according to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  she was initially seen by dr. a back in september 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  during those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in oregon by dr.  a in august 2001.  it was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by dr. b in july 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.    in addition, she had significant abnormal liver function tests with alt in the 600&#8242;s, ast 300&#8242;s with a bilirubin 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase in the 200&#8242;s.  ultrasound shows common bile duct of 6 mm post cholecystectomy.  the patient was then eventually referred to dr. w in oregon.  given the abnormal liver function tests and abnormal ultrasound, dr. w performed an ercp with sphincterotomy  in september 20, 2001.  because of the symptoms and the suspicions of sphincter of oddi dysfunction, a sphincterotomy was performed during the ercp.  procedure was uneventful.  the patient did well for a few months, but unfortunately got hospitalized again in may 2002 for recurrence of the abdominal pain and markedly elevated liver function tests with alt in the 600 to 900 range, again with nausea and vomiting.  after transient elevation, her liver function tests would normalize.   during her hospitalization, extensive work-up including ct scan, 24 hour urine collection for porphyrins, a percutaneous liver biopsy, and hepatitis panel, all of which were normal.  a repeat ercp with placement of endobiliary stent was uneventful and did not show evidence of pbc or psc.  after placement of the biliary stent, according to dr. w&#8217;s note, it apparently helped the patient with her symptoms with decreased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and pain.  mri of the abdomen was also performed in may 2002 showing a horseshoe kidney, which was previously known on old ct scans.  while the biliary stent was in place, the patient did have recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting and pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity.   finally in august 2002, the endobiliary stent was removed and there were no signs of obstruction.  thereafter, the patient actually did fairly well for about a year, but because of a recurrence of her symptoms, dr. w actually sent the patient up to ohsu for evaluation of this continued fairly mysterious abdominal pain.  the patient states that she saw dr. a who recommended some laboratory tests and a repeat ercp for further evaluation, but the patient did not want to go up to ohsu as she was somewhat unhappy with initial care.   then, over the course of the next several month, at the beginning of 2004, the patient&#8217;s symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and recurrence abdominal pain returned.  in fact, recently as the last documentation in may and june, the patient visited emergency room several times due to her symptoms.  lab tests show normal cbc with no signs of elevated white count.  ast and alt were normal.  alkaline phosphatase was in the low 200&#8242;s with minimally elevated lipase of 78.  bilirubin was completely normal.  the patient was given some zofran and that seemed to control her symptoms and then she was discharged and now referred to us for further evaluation.  at the present time, the patient is not having any abdominal pain.  she states she threw up three times in the morning and is feeling well at this point.  her abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting symptoms are random.  it does not associate with food.  it is not pre or post meal and occasionally will wake her up in the middle of the night.  she has not lost any weight despite this chronic nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.  her bowel habits have been fairly normal.  no hematemesis or melena.  no rashes, joint pain, or other symptoms have been noted.   allergies:  the patient has allergies to sulfa and codeine.   operations:  laparoscopic cholecystectomy, two ercp&#8217;s including stent placement and sphincterotomy. illnesses:  juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for which dr. b is following. medications:  the patient is on some type of anti-inflammatory, for which the name is unknown to her.  she is also taking some zofran.   habits:  she does not drink or smoke.   social history:  the patent moved up from eugene.  she currently lives up here and works in portland.   family history:  noncontributory. review of systems:  the patient has seen primarily dr. b, her rheumatologist, as primary care. data:  the patient&#8217;s extensive chart was reviewed.  it took over 45 minutes to sort through the chart and the labs.  physical examination:   the patient is a  23-year old female who appears well developed with no acute signs of distress.  hent:  normocephalic, atraumatic, perrla, eomi, sclerae are anicteric.  nares are patent and symmetrical.  the oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes and no obvious mucosal lesions.  the tongue is midline.  neck:  supple without adenopathy, jvd, or thyromegaly.  there&#8217;s no supraclavicular adenopathy.  lungs:  clear bilaterally with normal respiratory effort.  back:  nontender to palpation and there&#8217;s no cva tenderness or obvious spinal deformity.  cardiac:  regular rate and rhythm. no murmur.  abdomen:  soft, nondistended and nontender to palpation throughout with no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly, masses, fullness or ascites.  bowel sounds were present and did appear normal.  rectal:  deferred.  extremities:  without edema, calf tenderness or joint swelling.  neurologic:  shows the patient to be alert and oriented x&#8217;s 3 with normal gait.  skin:  warm and dry with normal color and no rashes.  impression:  a 23-year-old female with fairly mysterious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status post cholecystectomy and ercp with sphincterotomy.  she continues to have very intermittent elevated liver function tests and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  there was some discussion with dr. w in the past regarding extending the sphincterotomy to ensure that a complete sphincterotomy was performed if the patient should have sphincter of oddi dysfunction, however, at this time i am reluctant to do so without further reviewing the patient&#8217;s chart and investigating other avenues.  i think we will check another repeat liver function test and i think it may be helpful to repeat a liver biopsy to ensure we are not missing other primary liver diseases before concentrating purely on the biliary tree itself.  in addition, ama will be obtained along with a liver function test.  i would also like to obtain some discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office to further clarify what has transpired over the past three years.   plan:  1.  obtain discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office.2.  send the patient for a complete metabolic panel, ama.3.  send the patient for ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided liver biopsy.4.  the patient will return to see me in three weeks.  we will consider further options pending on these results of the test and review of the patient&#8217;s discharge summaries from dr. w&#8217;s office.  if the patient should show symptoms of pain and elevated liver function tests to be consistent with sphincter of oddi dysfunction, we may repeat the ercp and extend the sphincterotomy.  the entire case was discussed with the patient.  the patient is agreeable to the current plan.  thank you for this consultation.   followup:  in two to three weeks.",420

"reason for consultation: acute renal failure. history:  limited data is available; i have reviewed his admission notes. apparently this man was found down by a family member, was taken to medical center, and subsequently flown here. he has got respiratory failure, multi-organ system failure syndrome, and has renal insufficiency, as well. markers of renal function have been fairly stable. i do not presently see indicators that he historically has been oliguric. the bun and creatinine have been fairly stable. it is not clear whether he was taking his lisinopril up until the time of his demise, and it is also not clear whether he was taking his diuretic. earlier thoughts had been that he could have had rhabdomyolysis, but the highest cpk i find recorded is 1500, the phosphorus is not elevated, though i acknowledge the serum calcium is low. i see no markers of myoglobinuria nor serum level of myoglobin. he has received iv fluid resuscitation, good broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, continues mechanically ventilated, and is on parenteral nutrition. past medical history: not obtained from the patient, but is reviewed in other physician&#8217;s notes and seems notable for probably atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease wherein he was taking imdur and digoxin, reportedly. a suggestion of hypertensive disease versus bph, he was on terazosin. suggestion of chf versus hypertension versus volume overload, treated with lasix. he was iron, i presume for anemia. he was on potassium, lisinopril and aspirin. allergies: other physician&#8217;s notes indicate no known allergies. family history: not available. social history: not available. review of systems: not available. physical examination:general: an older white male who is intubated, edematous, and appears uncomfortable.heent: male pattern baldness. pupils equally round, no icterus. intubated. og tube in place.neck: not tested for suppleness, no carotid bruits are heard. neck vein distention is not seen.lungs: he has diffuse expiratory wheezing anteriorly, laterally and posteriorly. i would describe the wheezes as coarse. i hear no present rales. breath sounds otherwise are symmetrical.heart: heart tones regular to auscultation, currently without audible rub or gallop sounds.breasts: not enlarged.abdomen: on plane. bowel sounds presently are normal. abdomen, i believe, is soft on plane, normal bowel sounds, no bruits, no liver edge felt, no hjr, no spleen tip, no suprapubic fullness.gu: catheter draining a dark yellow urine.extremities: very edematous. pulses not palpable. cyanosis not observed. fungal changes are not observed.neurological: not otherwise assessed. laboratory data: reviewed. impression:1. acute renal failure, suspected. likely due to multi-organ system failure syndrome, with antecedent lisinopril use at home and at time of demise. he also reportedly was on lasix prior to hospitalization, ? hypovolemia as a consequence.2. multi-organ system failure/systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with septic shock.3. i am under-whelmed presently with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, if the maximum ck recorded is 1500.4. antecedent hypoxemia, with renal hypoperfusion.5. diffuse aspiration pneumonitis suggested. discussion/plan: i think the renal function will follow the patient. supportive care, attention to stability of a euvolemic state, will be important at this time. he is currently nonoliguric, has apparently stable, diffuse, bilateral wheezing, with adequate gas exchange. he is on tpn, antimicrobials, and has been on vasopressive agents. blood pressures are close to acceptable, he may now be wearing off his lisinopril, assuming he was taking it prior to admission. i would use diuretics to maintain central euvolemia. recorded i&#8217;s are substantially o&#8217;s during the course of the hospitalization, i presume as part of his resuscitation effort. no central pressures or monitoring of same is currently available. i will follow with you. no present indication for hemodialysis. antimicrobials are being handled by others.",422
"referral indication and preprocedure diagnoses1.  dilated cardiomyopathy.2.  ejection fraction less than 10%.3.  ventricular tachycardia.4.  bradycardia with likely high degree of pacing. procedures planned and performed1.  implantation of biventricular automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.2.  fluoroscopic guidance for lead implantation for biventricular automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.3.  coronary sinus venogram for left ventricular lead placement.4.  defibrillation threshold testing x2. fluoroscopy time:  18.5 minutes. medications at the time of study1.  vancomycin 1 g (the patient was allergic to penicillin).2.  versed 10 mg.3.  fentanyl 100 mcg.4.  benadryl 50 mg. clinical history:  the patient is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman with a dilated cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 10%, been referred for aicd implantation because of his low ejection fraction and a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  he has underlying sinus bradycardia.  therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device. risks and benefits:  risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular aicd and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  the patient agreed both verbally and via written consent. description of procedure:  the patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  the region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  lidocaine 1% (20 ml) was administered to the area.  after achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  lidocaine 1% (10 ml) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-french side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  the dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  the sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  one wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-french side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  the dilator and wire were removed.  a defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  the peel-away sheath was removed.  the lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  the active fix screw was deployed.  adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  a 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  the suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-french side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  the wire and dilator were removed.  an active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  the lead was parked until a later time.  using the separate access point, a 9-french side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  the dilator and wire were removed.  a curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  the coronary sinus was cannulated.  inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  a coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  it was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  this was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a whisper eds wire into a distal position.  adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  a 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  the outer sheath was peeled away.  the 9 french sheath was then peeled away.  suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  at this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed j-curved stylet.  the lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  a suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  the pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  the leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  the pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted. the patient was sedated further and shock on t was performed on two separate occasions.  the device was allowed to detect the charge and defibrillate, establishing the entire workings of the icd system. device data1.  pulse generator, manufacturer boston scientific, model #

"procedure:  left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography. complications:  none. procedure detail:  the right femoral area was draped and prepped in the usual fashion after xylocaine infiltration.  a 6-french arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  the right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  this was nondominant.  several catheters were used.  ultimately, an al1 diagnostic catheter was used.  a pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  left ventriculogram was then done in the rao view using 30 ml of contrast.  pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a perclose device with good results.  there were no complications.  he tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition. findings1.  right coronary artery:  this has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  the vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.2.  left main trunk:  a 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.3.  left anterior descending:  just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  the diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.4.  circumflex:  dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  after this, there is 40% narrowing in the av trunk.  the small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.5.  left ventriculogram:  normal volume in diastole and systole.  normal systolic function is present.  there is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction. diagnoses1.  severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  dominant circumflex system.  severe disease of the posterior descending.  mild left main trunk disease.2.  normal left ventricular systolic function. given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.  the patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant.  this anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.  the case will be reviewed with a cardiac surgeon.",426
"<strong>reason for referral:</strong> the patient is a 58-year-old african-american right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x. she is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the &#8220;early stages of a likely dementia&#8221; and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse. a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning. the patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results. <strong>relevant background information: </strong>historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient. a summary of pertinent information is presented below. please refer to the patient&#8217;s medical chart for a more complete history. <strong>history of presenting problem:</strong> the patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for hospital center for four years. she was dismissed from this position in september 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work. she continues to receive some compensation through fmla hours. she said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from state services. she said that these 90 days are up around the end of november. she said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints. she said that they began &#8220;as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor&#8217;s note for any days off. she said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays. she described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time. she said that since september 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback. in july of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time. following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, dr. y, ph.d. he completed a comprehensive independent medical evaluation on 08/14/2009. she said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore. please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence. the patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was &#8220;too derogatory.&#8221; a copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation. to summarize, the results indicated &#8220;diagnostically, the patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history. this suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.&#8221; it concluded that &#8220;results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy������� the patient&#8217; deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing. the prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other. following her dismissal, the patient presented to her primary physician, henry fein, m.d., who referred her to dr. x for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits. his neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable. the patient scored 20/30 on the mini-mental status exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting. a repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure. <strong>imaging studies: </strong>mri of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions. note that the mri was done with and without gadolinium contrast. <strong>current functioning: </strong>the patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her. when asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills. she also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems. she continues to independently perform all activities of daily living. she is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning. she reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention. she said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician. she said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application. other current symptoms include excessive fatigue. she reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia. she also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year. she said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot &#8220;like dragging.&#8221; dr. x&#8217;s physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. she said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body. muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip. <strong>other medical history: </strong>the patient reported that her birth and development were normal. she denied any significant medical conditions during childhood. as mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia. she also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm. mri of the c-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at c7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at c6-c7. mri of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon. as mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991. she thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control. she also has

the patient arrived unaccompanied and on time for her appointment. she ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were noted. vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing. she was neatly dressed and groomed. eye contact was good. she was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. speech was mildly slow and a few mild articulatory errors were noted near the end of the day, and a few paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming task. there were otherwise no apparent problems with expression and speech was normal with respect to rhythm and prosody. she was somewhat quiet, but quite cooperative throughout the day. affect appeared to be mildly constricted, but she smiled and joked appropriately at times. mood appeared to be euthymic. receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner&#8217;s questions and instructions. thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted. she appeared quite tired near the end of the day and it should be noted that sustained attention task was the last test that was given at the end of the day. when asked, the patient said that she recognized some of the tests that were given, but not most of them. she denied having look up any information on any of the tests that are typically involved in a neuropsychological battery or having any additional information about them since her last testing. overall, the patient appeared to put full effort into this evaluation. she was highly motivated and thus these results should be seen as an accurate reflection of her current cognitive functioning. note that there was some overlap in tests that were administered during this evaluation and those given at her evaluation in august of 2009. these include the ways for cpt ii, verbal fluency, and boston naming test, but this exception of the ways for most of these tests are not expected to have a significant practice effect associated with them; however, they will be interpreted with her recent evaluation in mind. <strong>evaluation findings:</strong> classification level |&#8211;|

|&#8212;&#8211;| &lt; 28 <strong>general cognitive ability: </strong>the patient performed in the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning. her performances were within expected limits across subtests assessing attention, initiation, visuospatial construction, conceptualization, and memory. <strong>intellectual functioning: </strong>based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the average range. current intellectual functioning fell in the average range (full scale iq equals 98, 45th percentile). her index scores also indicated average performance across tasks assessing the verbal knowledge and comprehension, visuospatial perception and reasoning, working memory (i.e. complex attention) and information processing. significant relative strengths were seen on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge and nonverbal reasoning. significant relative weaknesses were seen on task assessing visuospatial perception and construction that included a time demand (low average). compared to her previous test results, the pattern of findings is quite similar with stronger performance on verbal relative to nonverbal tasks or those with significant working memory or speed demands. however, she performed somewhat better on most of these tasks in the current evaluation. to some degree this likely reflects measurement error and variability in addition to some practice effects, although some tests are less susceptible to such changes relative to others. <strong>academic achievement: </strong>the patient performed within the average range across tasks assessing word reading, sentence comprehension, and spelling skills. her previous evaluation referred to a number of misspellings that she had made on her list of medications and certain medical conditions and she made consistent errors again during this evaluation suggesting that she may simply have a weakness in this area. <strong>attention: </strong>auditory working memory was within the average range. visual working memory was low average. on a selective visual attention test, she demonstrated good accuracy in finding target stimuli while scanning information, although her overall speed was in the low average range. on a continuous performance test assessing sustained attention, she also demonstrated good accuracy, although it was noted that her response time tended to be slower when stimuli were presented with a longer interstimulus interval suggesting some difficulty adapting to changes in the temporal stimulus presentation. note that this latter performance is entirely consistent with her previous results and taken together these results suggest that attentional abilities were generally within expectations with some mildly weaker performance for complex visual relative to verbal information. there were inconsistencies noted in attentional abilities for both verbal and visual working memory. <strong>information processing speed: </strong>as noted, the patient had some difficulty adapting to changes in stimulus presentation speed on sustained attention task and there was some suggestion in her performances that she reduced her speed in order to increase accuracy; however, basic visual scanning and sequencing and psychomotor processing were in the average to high average range. <strong>language: </strong>mild articulatory and paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming test. verbal retrieval for phonemic or category cues were in the high average and average range respectively. stored verbal knowledge was in the average range with as mentioned strengths noted in vocabulary. those language abilities were generally within expected limits. <strong>visuospatial perception and construction: </strong>the patient demonstrated variability in her performances on tasks assessing visuospatial perception and construction. basic visual perception assessed through her ability to accurately interpret angular line orientations was in the high average. mental organization and synthesis of parts of visual figures was in the average range on an untimed task that involved namable objects and in the low average range and relative weakness when it involved timed synthesis of shapes. visuospatial construction using either line drawings or blocks to match to a sample design was in the borderline to low average range. thus taken together, the patient demonstrated some relative weaknesses in aspects of visuospatial processing, particularly when tasks involved the time component or shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. <strong>learning &amp; memory skills:</strong> <strong>verbal learning and memory:</strong> initial acquisition of a list of 15 unrelated items within the high average range (she successfully recalled eight items). she benefited significantly from repetition and demonstrated immediate and significant improvement in her recall, although across five learning trials, her learning curve was mildly inconsistent suggesting attentional weaknesses; however, following the fifth trial, her overall learning fell in the superior range (all 15 items were successfully recalled). spontaneous recall following a 20-minute delay was in the average range as she was able to remember 11 of the 15 items. she correctly recognized all those items during recognition (high average). taking together these memory results are well within expected limits. she demonstrated some mild forgetting, but still fell within the average range and was able to recognize items effectively suggesting mild weaknesses and inconsistencies with retrieval and attentional weaknesses may have contributed to variability in her learning curve initially. <strong>visual learning and memory: </strong>the patient&#8217; immediate recall of a complex figure was in the average range. she retained all of that information following a delay and her recall was in the high average range. recognition of the individual components of the figure was impaired. taken together these results highlight some difficulties with complex visuospatial perception and construction, although memory per se was intact based on her very strong recall performances. note also that she demonstrated this strong memory despite some initial errors in her copy of the complex figure itself again highlighting difficulties with perception and construction, but good overall memory functioning. <strong>executive functioning: </strong>as mentioned, working memory was stronger for verbal than visual information, but both were within broad normal limits. verbal fluency was within expected limits as well and she demonstrated particular strength in switching between semantic categories (very superior). design fluency was average. cognitive set shifting, inhibition of prepotent responses and planning and problem solving all fell within the average to high average range and within expected limits. abstract reasoning for visual and verbal information was also good. thus taken together, the patient did not demonstrate any difficulties with tasks assessing executive functioning. <strong>motor functioning:</strong> fine motor coordination skills were within the average range with both her right dominant hand and left hand. strength was impaired on both sides while basic motor speed was in the borderline range for both hands. these results are very similar to those that were found in her previous evaluation. they are consistent with decreased strength, but no loss of dexterity and they do not suggest any lateralized deficits. <strong>emotional functioning: </strong>on an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only three items suggesting reduced energy and reduced clarity of thinking. overall, these results suggest that she is not experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms at this time. <strong>summary &amp; impressions: </strong>this is a 58-year-old african-american female with 16 years of education who is referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x in order to assess for possible cognitive impairment. she reported that she had recently been terminated from her position as a supervisory nurse in a psychiatric hospital following a neuropsychological evaluation that concluded that she may be in the &#8220;early stages of a likely dementia&#8221;. this evaluation was requested as a second opinion in order to clarify the nature of her cognitive impairment and make recommendations for ongoing treatment planning. overall, intellectual functioning fell in the average range on this evaluation. note that the same battery of tests was used in order to assess intellectual functioning and given the recency of her previous evaluation to some degree practice effects may have impacted her performance. however, we would not expect as significant of an impact upon tasks assessing processing speed and working memory. the same pattern of performance was noted across subtests in the intellectual battery with stronger performance on verbal knowledge based tasks relative to those assessing processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial skills. however, during this evaluation, she demonstrated significant improvement across tasks so that in general her profile is elevated, but the same profile pattern was seen. note that along with practice effects, performance can also be impacted by changes in attention, as well as measurement error. the possibility of attentional fluctuations having contributed to some of her performance is a definite possibility based on her performance on some attention tasks, which suggested that she at times performed better and was able to sequence in mind more information than she was able to passively repeat and she demonstrated inconsistencies in her learning curve on the memory task. our assessment of her intelligence as falling within the average range is consistent with our estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning and educational and occupational history. note that the ways for technical manual indicates that test retest gains are less pronounced for verbal comprehension and working memory subtests than perceptual reasoning and processing speed subtests and the patient&#8217; improvements were much higher than the mean increases in the normative sample that averaged a shorter period between testing and retesting. this suggests that as noted above other factors were applied, perhaps including attentional fluctuations. relative to intellectual functioning, the patient performed within expected limits across tasks assessing language functioning, verbal and visual memory, and executive skills and sustained attention. variability in performances was seen for information processing speed, particularly when responding to changes in the tempo of stimulus presentation or making more complex visual discriminations. immediate attention was also somewhat variable as she should be able to mentally manipulate greater amounts of visual and verbal material and she could just passively replicate. the better performance on raw scores on these more complex tasks is unusual and suggests fluctuations in attention for reasons other than brain base deficits. she also demonstrated weaker skills in complex visuospatial processing, particularly for shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. of note, she performed poorly when these tasks involved the time component. meteorically, she demonstrated bilateral impairments in strength and motor speed, but dexterity and fine motor manipulation skills were within expected limits. the lack of lateralizing information and motor skills suggests that more peripheral factors and pain may have contributed to these results. taken together, these results do not necessarily suggest that there has been any significant decline from premorbid levels. it is possible that the patient has always had weaknesses in visuospatial processing and note that these weaknesses were not in basic visual skills and processing skills, but rather in putting together shapes and figures. the inconsistencies in her performances on processing speed and attention tasks suggest that while she may be somewhat slowed in completing tasks, there may be contributors other than brain base changes that impacted her results. in particular, the patient&#8217; current medications, as well as pain, fatigue, and medical conditions such as diabetes and associated possible neuropathy are likely important factors. results do not suggest the presence of a progressive dementing disorder. given the multiple factors that may have contributed to some of our findings, we do not believe that any cognitive disorder should be diagnosed at this time. if there are significant concerns about her cognitive functioning, it may be useful to make adjustments in her medication regimen. this is a not a work based evaluation and therefore questions regarding her ability to perform job duties will not be addressed. one concern that we would like to bring up is that if visuospatial problems are of newer onset, they may be contributing to her recent falls and thus should be monitored for changes and progression and she should return for reevaluation in one year&#8217;s time in order to determine any changes in her cognitive functioning. additional recommendations are provided below. note that there was a little overlap in tests given between the two testing sessions aside from the ways for cpt to word fluency. also note that she completed the brief self-report instrument and all of her results fell within normal limits. <strong>recommendations:</strong> 1. based on fluctuations in processing speed and attention, it is possible that the patient&#8217; current medications may be impacting her cognitive functioning to some degree. decisions regarding any changes are deferred to her physicians, but it may be useful to streamline her current medications while also continuing to effectively address symptoms. 2. the patient should return for reevaluation in one year&#8217;s time to monitor her cognitive functioning and evaluate for any improvements in performance following any medication changes. note also that stress related to her work situation and the nature of her previous neuropsychological evaluation may have also contributed to some of her difficulties on that testing. 3. the nature of her frequent falls is uncertain, but it is possible that weaknesses in visuospatial processing may be contributing and this should be further evaluated by her physicians.",427
"history of present illness:  this is a 41-year-old registered nurse (r.n.).  she was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  the patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  she notes starting in january, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  it turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  the patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  they had moved to abcd where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  she also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  she has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  in january, she went on citalopram.  she reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood. past and developmental history:  she was born in xyz.  she describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  father was a truckdriver.  she is an only child.  she reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  in her 20s, she served six years in naval reserve.  she was previously married for four years.  she described that as an abusive relationship.  she had a history of being in counseling with abc, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice. physical examination:  general:  this is an alert and cooperative woman.vital signs:  temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.psychiatric:  she makes good eye contact.  speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  there is no thought disorder.  she denies being suicidal.  her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  she has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  she appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment. medical history is notable for factor v leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  she has been off her mirapex.  i did encourage her to go back on the mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep. the patient at this time can contract for safety.  she has made plans for outpatient counseling this saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with. laboratory data:  inr, which is still 8.8.  in 1998, she had a normal mri.  electrolytes, bun, creatinine, and cbc were all normal. diagnoses:  1.  seasonal depressive disorder.2.  restless legs syndrome.3.  overdose of citalopram and warfarin. recommendations:  the patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  i, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  if needed, she can take prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  she does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling. please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information i can provide.",428
"name of procedure1.  left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.2.  percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery. history:  this is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  the patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  the patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization. procedure details:  informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  using modified seldinger technique, a 6-french arterial sheath was placed.  then, the patient had already been on heparin.  then, a judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  a 3drc catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  then, a 3drc guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  integrilin was given.  then, a 3.0 x 12 voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  then, a projection was obtained.  then, a 3.0 x 15 vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  the stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  however, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  then, the stent delivery system was removed.  a pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an angio-seal was applied.  the patient was transferred back to his room in good condition. findings1.  hemodynamics:  the opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  the opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  lv pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  the closing pressure was 110/67.2.  left ventriculography:  the left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  there is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  the overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  the mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  the aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.3.  coronary angiography:  the left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  this bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  the left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  the left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  it gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  the first diagonal branch was large.  the left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  the left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  the two obtuse marginal branches are large.  there is a relatively small left atrial branch.  the left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  the rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  the right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  the right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  however, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  the rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  there is improvement from timi grade 2 to timi grade 3 flow. clinical impression1.  successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.2.  two-vessel coronary artery disease.3.  elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.4.  mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis. recommendations1.  integrilin.2.  bed rest.3.  risk factor modification.4.  thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks.",429
